## Stellar Structure
A star is generally governed by the following ODEs
**Hydrostatic Equilibrium**
$$
\frac{dP}{dr} = -\frac{GM_r\rho}{r^2}
$$
**Mass Continuity**
$$
\frac{dM_r}{dr} = 4\pi r^2\rho
$$
**Energy Production**
$$
\frac{dL_r}{dr} = 4\pi r^2\rho\varepsilon
$$
with $L_r$ being energy flux
**Temperature Gradient**
$$
\frac{dT}{dr} = \left(-\frac{3}{4ac}\right)\left(\frac{\kappa\rho}{T^3}\right)\left(\frac{L_r}{4\pi r^2}\right)
$$

## Formation of Stars in Brief
>Qualitatively, it is as follows -> will find more rigorous descriptions of the process that occurs in each stage

Molecular clouds get [squased together by shock waves](https://lifeng.lamost.org/courses/astrotoday/CHAISSON/AT319/HTML/AT31905.HTM) to create gravitational strongholds that then attracts the gas surrounding it - forming clumps of nebula called **protostars**

Accretion disk of gas and dust forms around the *protostar* - it becomes **hotter as it contracts under its own gravity**

As it becomes hotter and denser it forms a **T-Tauri** star -> characterised by strong stellar winds blowing from it -> this is powered by Lithium burning

Eventually, the center of the star becomes hot and dense enough for **nuclear fusion to start**. *The start stops collapsing once the radiation reaches the surface and halt the collapse* 
>A starâ€™s life is all about a battle between the radiation pressure from within and gravitational collapse of the star itself -> **hydrostatic equilibirum???**

*Why does the T-Tauri star become less luminous??*


Formation of stars

**T-Tauri Star** follows the Hayashi track -> becomes less luminous and same temperature
-> Nuclear fusion then starts and the star slowly collapses and reach hydrostatic equilibrium -> becomes hotter but stays at the same luminosity


Hayashi track is more dominant for less massive stars

while the massive stars almost immediately enters the Henyey track as they start nuclear fusion earlier due to their larger size
