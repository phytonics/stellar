## Genesis

The red giant, in its lifetime loses atmospheric material due to ejections and interstellar shock waves. This is usually invisible and just end up flying off into interstellar space. However, as the red giant approaches its death, the temperature of the core is hot enough to emit ultraviolet radiation which ionizes the ejected material causing it to glow brightly in a formation known as the **planetary nebula**.

## White Dwarf
In the center of a planetary nebula lies a super hot star that glows only faintly (in comparison to other stars). This is known as a [white dwarf](../dwarves/white_dwarf.md)
