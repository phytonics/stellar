# The Death of Massive Stars

!!! Note "Just a Note"
    As with the previous one, for the sake of concision, this page will be incredibly short, but we hope you take away some useful information from here. In addition, some of the information here is likely inaccurate due to the fact that the life and death of high-mass stars is very poorly understood.

Remember when I told you that silicon fusion is one of the main problems encountered by Massive Stars?

Well it is. At perhaps the peak temperature, silicon finally gives in and burns, forming a nickel nucleus... which slowly decays to **iron**.

Finally, we're at the absolute highest point of nuclear binding energy possible. And the core slowly evolves as such, forming an iron core which finally descends... into collapse. **Catastrophic collapse**.

Simply put, the photons possess such high energy that they manage to _disintegrate_ the nuclei, a process known as **photodisintegration**. But this removes radiation pressure from the equation, leaving the star to cave to gravity, and the protons to degenerate.

But **how** catastrophic is this collapse?

The iron core, once sized as large as the mighty Earth, collapses to the size of Singapore in about a second. This is a collapse speed of a **quarter of the speed of light**. The density and temperature of the core increases, and we watch as the lighter radiative and convective zones bounce off the iron core, spreading out into the universe in what we call a **supernova**.

What happens next... is up to the core. If it's really so large, it descends into a supermassive black hole... but if not, it remains a cute little neutron star, left to find its purpose further on.
