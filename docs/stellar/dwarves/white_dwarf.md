# White Dwarves


## Genesis

As the red giant's core runs out of helium to burn, it collapses under its own gravity as there is no longer any fuel to create countervailing pressure. 

The white dwarf forms in parallel with the [planetary nebula](../others/planetary_nebula.md) at the death of the [red giant](../giants/red_giant.md), it is the exposed core of the red giant after its atmosphere has been sweep away by stellar winds.
