# Binary White Dwarves

Previously, we have considered stars as isolated systems that evolve independently. However, most stars in the universe exist not as isolated stars, but as binaries, where two stars orbit their shared center of mass. When one of the stars in a binary system becomes a white dwarf, it forms what is known as a **Binary White Dwarf System**. 

## Recap: White Dwarves

Recall that a white dwarf is the result of the death of a low-mass star, where its gas envelope has been stripped away to leave only the carbon core at the center. Nuclear fusion no longer occurs within the core of the white dwarf and it glows its white color simply due to its remaining heat. When a red giant eventually forms a white dwarf, what remains is usually simply a husk that will slowly cool as it radiates its remaining heat, eventually forming a black dwarf. However, in a binary system, the white dwarf has the potential to evolve further -- and in far mmore spectacular ways.

## The Characteristics of Binary Systems

In a binary system, the space around the system is affected by the gravitational pull of both stars. A common representation of this is each star being surrounded by its **Roche lobe**, a teardrop-shaped zone. Within the zone, the star's gravity dominates its partner's pull. The lobes of the two stars meet at a point between them known as the **Lagrangian point**, where the gravity of the two is balanced. Larger stars, owing to their stronger gravitational pull, have larger Roche lobes and further Lagrangian points along the line between the two.
