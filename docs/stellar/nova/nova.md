# Nova
Novas are a kind of star that have sudden, large increases in brightness before fading back to their original brightness. Stargazers of ancient times believed that new stars were created, as the bursts of light seemed to appear from nowhere in the night sky -- hence their name *nova*, which means "new" in Latin. 

Astronomers today now know that novas are not, in fact, new stars, but rather white dwarves -- stars that have already reached the end of their main sequence and are now husks of mainly carbon and oxygen. 

## Where does the light come from?
White dwarves are stars that are "dead": nuclear fusion no longer occurs in them, and their faint white glow comes from the radiation they produce due to whatever temperature they have left. Obviously, the burst of light from a nova could not possibly come from within a single white dwarf without any other interference.

In reality, novas cannot occur with any white dwarf, but rather only those that are in **[Binary White Dwarf Systems](../dwarves/binary_white_dwarf.md)**. In a binary white dwarf system, the white dwarf tends to attract gas from its partner to itself, which forms an **accretion disk** around the white dwarf. The accretion disk is very hot, and hence radiates in the visible spectrum -- most of the light visible from the white dwarf in a binary system comes not from the white dwarf itself but its accretion disk. 

## Hydrogen Accumulation
The gases in the accretion disk cannot keep on orbiting the white dwarf forever -- resistive forces caused by viscosity in the gas surrounding the white dwarf cause the gas to slow down and fall towards the white dwarf, eventually landing on its surface. As more gas builds up on the surface of the white dwarf, it gets hotter and denser.

Eventually, the hydrogen gets hotter and hotter until reaching a critical point of about 20 million Kelvin, at which point the hydrogen ignites and begins to undergo nuclear fusion into helium. As a refresher, this nuclear reaction is exactly the same as the reaction that the cores of stars in their main sequence undergo to produce their energy.
