# Massive Stars

!!! Note "Just a Note"
    For the sake of concision, this page will be incredibly short, but we hope you take away some useful information from here. In addition, some of the information here is likely inaccurate due to the fact that the life and death of high-mass stars is very poorly understood.

Ah, high mass stars. Stars so big, yet so very enigmatic... even today. Massive stars have an elaborate backstory that we won't go in depth into, but we do need to know the most crucial steps, which we'll cover in summary here.

Massive stars were once **Herbig Ae/Be Stars**, such large and incredibly complex Pre-Main Sequence stars that speed through the Hayashi Track and don't even need to enter the Henyey Track: they're large enough.

But as time evolves, so do they. Slowly but surely, the star becomes larger and larger, as a set of chain reactions, such as oxygen burning, neon burning and silicon burning lead to a giant release of energy. That last one is crucially a problem, one we will get to [later](../../others/massive_star_death). But for now, we know from the [low-mass stars](../low_mass_star) that after a certain point, the star reaches a critical giant point. In this case, the giant star becomes a **red supergiant**, which in many ways is similar to how red giants are formed for low-mass stars.

Trouble is abrew, however. Trouble [soon to be explained](../../others/massive_star_death).

But before I end off, I would like to share this video which illustrates the journey taken by High Mass Stars.
