## Star Formation
*Reference*
Formation of stars

**T-Tauri Star** follows the Hayashi track -> becomes less luminous and same temperature
-> Nuclear fusion then starts and the star slowly collapses and reach hydrostatic equilibrium -> becomes hotter but stays at the same luminosity


Hayashi track is more dominant for less massive stars

while the massive stars almost immediately enters the Henyey track as they start nuclear fusion earlier due to their larger size
