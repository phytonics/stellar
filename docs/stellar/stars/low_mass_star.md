#### Formation of stars
**T-Tauri Star** follows the Hayashi track -> 
-> Nuclear fusion then starts and the star slowly collapses and reach hydrostatic equilibrium -> becomes hotter but stays at the same luminosity.

Hayashi track is more dominant for less massive stars while the massive stars almost immediately enters the Henyey track as they start nuclear fusion earlier due to their larger size.

#### Hayashi track
The pre-main sequence star is fully convective, in a state of convective equilibrium, and contracting toward its final size, is known as the **Hayashi track**. They become less luminous and stay at the same temperature (taking a vertical path in the HR diagram).
