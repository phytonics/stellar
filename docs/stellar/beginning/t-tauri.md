## The T-Tauri star

T-tauri stars are young stars which have not yet commenced nuclear fusion. Their temperature is similar to that of a main sequence star, but are much mroe luminous as a result of their larger radius. They are characterised by strong X-ray and radio emissions, as well as powerful stellar winds. 

In this phase, the circumstellar disk formed during protostar phase also begins to disappate because of loss of mass, excessive heat or simply because it is blown away by the solar winds. 


### Lithium Burning
If the mass of the T-tauri star is more than 60 times the mass of jupiter, this light intermediary phase is sufficient to support a reaction known as lithium burning.

The nuclear reactions for Lithium Burning are as follows. 

A proton fuses with lithium to form beryllium,

$$
p + \ce{^{6}_{3}Li} \rightarrow \ce{^{7}_{4}Be}
$$

Since $\ce{^7_4Be}$ is unstable, it emits $\beta$ radiation.

$$
\ce{^{7}_{4}Be} \rightarrow \ce{^7_3Li} + e^+ + v
$$

Another proton fuses with this nucleus,

$$
p + \ce{^{7}_{3}Li} \rightarrow \ce{^{8}_{4}Be} 
$$

And $\ce{^8_4Be}$ breaks apart into helium, where it is stable.

$$
\ce{^8_4Be} \rightarrow 2 \ce{^4_2He}+\text{energy}
$$


## Transition into the main sequence

When the lithium within the star has expended, the centre of the star is typically hot enough to enter the _main sequence_.

If there are no big deviances of the composition of the star, the mass at which a star achieves hydrostatic equilibrium will have huge implications on the evolution of the star. 

If the mass is larger than 0.08 solar masses, then the energy is sufficient to cause the core of the star to become radiative. The heat causes the optical opacity of the star to drop, allowing energy to be radiated out quickly. As the star settles into its new equilibrium temperature, it turns into a [Low Mass Star](../stars/low_mass_star.md).

If the protostar never exceeds 0.08 solar masses, then it does not have enough energy to form a radiative core, and becomes a [Brown Dwarf](../dwarves/brown_dwarf.md).
