# T-Tauri

## The T-Tauri star

The protostar at some point becomes massive enough that it can be considered a _T-Tauri_ Star. T tauri stars are intermediaries between protostars and low-mass stars. If the mass of the T-tauri star is more than 60 times the mass of jupiter, this light intermediary phase is sufficient to support a reaction known as lithium burning.

The circumstellar disk from the protostar phase also begins to disappate. This can happen because of loss of mass, excessive heat or simply because it is blown away by the protostellar jets. 

### Lithium Burning

The nuclear reactions for Lithium Burning are as follows. 

A proton fuses with lithium to form beryllium,

$$
p + \ce{^{6}_{3}Li} \rightarrow \ce{^{7}_{4}Be}
$$

Since $\ce{^7_4Be}$ is unstable, it emits $\beta$ radiation.

$$
\ce{^{7}_{4}Be} \rightarrow \ce{^7_3Li} + e^+ + v
$$

Another proton fuses with this nucleus,

$$
p + \ce{^{7}_{3}Li} \rightarrow \ce{^{8}_{4}Be} 
$$

And $\ce{^8_4Be}$ breaks apart into helium, where it is stable.

$$
\ce{^8_4Be} \rightarrow 2 \ce{^4_2He}+\text{energy}
$$


## Transition into the main sequence

When the lithium within the star has expended, the centre of the star is typically hot enough to enter the _main sequence_.

If there are no big deviances of the composition of the star, the mass at which a star achieves hydrostatic equilibrium will have huge implications on the evolution of the star. 

TODO: t tauri to low mass stars

If the protostar never exceeds 0.08 times the mass of the sun, then it does not have the necessary conditions for hydrogen fusion. These failed stars are called brown dwarves.
