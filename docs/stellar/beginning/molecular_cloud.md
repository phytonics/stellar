# Molecular clouds

In the beginning, there was nothing but space and gas. A lot, a lot of gas. 

A molecular cloud is a cloud of light gas (mostly H$_2$) and dust. These humongous clouds tend to take on twisted, long shapes, usually described as "_filamentary_". 

If the mass of a cloud exceeds the threshold (the Jeans Mass) where pressure can maintain equilibrium, _gravitational collapse_ begins, kickstarting the formation of a star.

Sometimes, an external event starts off this process. In _triggered star formation_, colliding clouds or gravitational waves compress gas on astronomical scales, accelerating the star formation process and causing a phenomena called _starbursts_. 

## The star formation begins

When a cloud's mass exceeds the Jeans Mass, a phenomenon called cloud collapse occurs, in which the gravitational forces exceed gas pressure, turbulence, rotation and the magnetic field of the cloud.

Gas collapses inwards into balls at multiple points within the molecular cloud, forming smatterings of dustballs known as...
