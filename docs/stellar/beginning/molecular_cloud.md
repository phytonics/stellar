# Molecular clouds

In the beginning, there was nothing but space and gas. A lot, a lot of gas. 

A molecular cloud is a cloud of light gas (mostly H$_2$) and dust. These humongous clouds tend to take on twisted, long shapes, usually described as "filamentary". 

If the mass of a cloud exceeds the threshold (the Jeans Mass) where pressure can maintain equlibrium, _gravitational collapse_ begins, kickstarting the formation of a star.

<TODO: Causes of collapse?>

## The star formation begins

When a cloud's mass exceeds the Jeans Mass, a phenomenon called cloud collapse occurs, in which the gravitational forces exceed gas presure, turbulence, rotation and the magnetic field. 

Gas collapses inwards into balls at multiple points within the molecular cloud, forming smatterings of protostars.
