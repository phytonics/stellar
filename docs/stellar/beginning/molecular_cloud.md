# Molecular clouds

In the beginning, there was nothing but space and gas. A lot, a lot of gas. 

A molecular cloud is a cloud of light gas (mostly H$_2$) and dust. These humongous clouds tend to take on twisted, long shapes, usually described as "_filamentary_". 

If the mass of a cloud exceeds the threshold (the Jeans Mass) where pressure can maintain equilibrium, _gravitational collapse_ begins, kickstarting the formation of a star.

Sometimes, an external event starts off this process. In _triggered star formation_, colliding clouds or gravitational waves compress gas on astronomical scales, accelerating the star formation process. This causes a phenomena called _starbursts_, where the number of stars formed within the molecular cloud is much higher than normal levels,

## The star formation begins

When a cloud's mass exceeds the Jeans Mass, the gravitational forces of the dust gradually begins to overcome gas pressure, turbulence, rotation, and the magnetic field of the cloud. This leads to _cloud collapse_, where gas collapses inwards into balls at multiple points within the molecular cloud, forming smatterings of dustballs known as...
