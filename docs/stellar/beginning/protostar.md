# The Protostar

The ball of gas formed from cloud collapse is not quite a star yet. The interstellar dust particles that are being pulled in collide with each other, generating heat which radiates outwards as infrared radiation (Since its heat is still relatively low). 

Gas is pulled into a disk-like shape around the protostar as it falls towards the growing clump. This is a process known as accretion. 

For scale, protostar accretion disks are generally larger than the solar system. Within these accretion disks planets or other stars are often formed.

As its mass increases, the protostar gradually becomes opaque to its own radiation. Heat can no longer escape the core of the nascent star, and interesting things start to happen.
