# The Protostar

A protostar is a young star which is still gathering mass from its parent molecular cloud through a process called accretion. In this state, it is not yet hot enough for hydrogen fusion to occur.

Gravity pulls gas into a disk-like shape around the protostar, called a _circumstellar disk_. Particles that are pulled in collide with each other, generating heat.

At first, heat is lost rapidly to the void of space through radiation. However, as its mass increases, the protostar gradually becomes opaque to its own radiation. Heat can no longer escape and begins accumulating at the core of the nascent star.

Accretion of dust from the circumstellar disk continues until the star is hot enough to reach a state of _hydrostatic equilibrium_.

The mass at which a star achieves hydrostatic equilibrium depends on many factors.



If the protostar never exceeds temperatures of 10$^7$K, then it becomes a _brown dwarf_.
