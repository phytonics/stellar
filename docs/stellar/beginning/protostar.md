A protostar is a young star which is still gathering mass from its parent molecular cloud through a process called accretion. In this state, it is not yet hot enough for hydrogen fusion to occur.

Gravity pulls gas into a disk-like shape around the protostar, called a _circumstellar disk_. Accretion of dust from the circumstellar disk continues until the star is hot enough to reach a state of _hydrostatic equilibrium_. This accretion is the main source of energy for the star, as shock from matter smashing into the face of the star is turned into heat. 

At first, heat is lost rapidly to the void of space through radiation. However, as its mass increases, the protostar gradually becomes opaque to its own radiation. Heat can no longer escape and begins accumulating at the core of the nascent star.

Angular momentum from the falling mass is regulated by shooting streams of matter outwards perpendicular to the circumstellar disk.
