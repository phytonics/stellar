# The Protostar

A protostar is a young star which is still gathering mass from its parent molecular cloud through a process called accretion. In this state, it is not yet hot enough for hydrogen fusion to occur.

Gravity pulls gas into a disk-like shape around the protostar, called a _circumstellar disk_. Particles that are pulled in collide with each other, generating heat.

At first, heat is lost rapidly to the void of space through radiation. However, as its mass increases, the protostar gradually becomes opaque to its own radiation. Heat can no longer escape and begins accumulating at the core of the nascent star.

Accretion of dust from the circumstellar disk continues until the star is hot enough to reach a state of _hydrostatic equilibrium_.

## The T-Tauri star

The protostar at some point becomes massive enough that it can be considered a _T-Tauri_ Star. If the mass of the star is more than 60 times the mass of jupiter, this light intermediary phase is sufficient to support a reaction known as lithium burning.

### Lithium Burning

The nuclear reactions for Lithium Burning are as follows. 

A proton fuses with lithium to form beryllium,

$$
p + \ce{^{6}_{3}Li} \rightarrow \ce{^{7}_{4}Be}
$$

Since $\ce{^7_4Be}$ is unstable, it emits $\beta$ radiation.

$$
\ce{^{7}_{4}Be} \rightarrow \ce{^7_3Li} + e^+ + v \text{ }
$$

Another proton fuses with this nucleus,

$$
p + \ce{^{7}_{3}Li} \rightarrow \ce{^{8}_{4}Be} 
$$

And $\ce{^8_4Be}$ breaks apart into helium, where it is stable.

$$
\ce{^8_4Be} \rightarrow 2 \ce{^4_2He}+\text{energy}
$$

## Transition into the main sequence

When the lithium within the star has expended, the centre of the star is typically hot enough to enter the _main sequence_.

If there are no big deviances of the composition of the star, the mass at which a star achieves hydrostatic equilibrium will have huge implications on the evolution of the star. 

If the protostar never exceeds 0.08 times the mass of the sun, then it does not have the necessary conditions for hydrogen fusion. These failed stars are called brown dwarves.

#TODO: brown dwarf temperature doesnt exceed 10^7K -> no hydrogen fusion?
