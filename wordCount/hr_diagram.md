# The Hertzsprungâ€“Russell Diagram

## Overview
The HR Diagram was developed years ago to represent the relationship between the Luminosity, $L$ and the Surface Temperature, $T$. Let's start by exploring the history of this diagram.

## History

The HR Diagram was the brainchild of its namesake, Danish astronomer **Ejnar Hertzsprung** (1873 - 1967) and American astronomer **Henry Norris Russell** (1877 - 1957). It was developed independently by both astronomers, in 1911 and 1914 respectively.

The original HR Diagram was completely different from that pictured in [Figure 1.3.1](#fig121). It looked a lot more than what is shown below:

Notice that the y-axis is the Absolute Visual Magnitude, while the x-axis is populated by letters. These are Spectral Classes, which I've left as optional reading down below:

## The Modern HR Diagram

The diagram looks as such


### Key Features

The Key Features of the HR Diagram is as follows:

- Vertical Axis is some variant of the Luminosity, $L$ or Absolute Visual Magnitude, $M$. <br>(As we learnt in [The Magnitude Scale](../magnitude_scale), Absolute Visual Magnitude is a scaled form of $\log L$.)
- Horizontal Axis is Temperature, but **note**, the axis is flipped. This means that as we go the right of the diagram, the temperature is in fact decreasing.

The shape on the graph is largely predicated on what stars you identify, but most stars, as mentioned before, fall into the **main sequence**, the long line spanning the top left to bottom right of the graph. For the sake of this discussion, let's briefly go through each type of star.

### Main Sequence

The behaviour of the main sequence stars is aptly describe by the *Stefan-Boltzmann* law, which states

$$L = Ae\sigma T^4$$

Based of the above rule, we've been able to gether that stars with higher temperatures largely shine brighter. It is crucial to note that $T$ is scaled up via the significant exponent, that being "4". Hence most stars do operate based on this logic.

For instance, here is a diagram I've plotted to show the relation:

Of course, you can always relate it to the star's nuclear output, which is governed by Einstein's most famous equation,

$$E = mc^2$$

This means that logically, a more massive star has a higher radioactive output, which means that the mass has a significant effect on this situation as will. Stars often spend billions and billions of years in this class, before it moves on to others.

#### Pre-Main Sequence
Pre-Main Sequence Stars tend to follow two different tracks to enter on their journey, the **Henyey and Hayashi Tracks**.

To represent them as a diagram, here is a good depiction:

##### The Hayashi Track


The **Hayashi Track** is the almost vertical "path" that protostars (with masses less than $3 M_\odot$) take down the HR diagram.

It represents the gravitational collapse of [T Tauri stars](../../beginning/t-tauri), wherein the collapsing star becomes less luminous because as the star contracts, there is less area available for the star to emit light.

##### The Henyey Track
The **Henyey Track** is a the nearly horizontal "path" to the main sequence that stars take after the Hayashi track, or right as they form if they have sufficient mass kickstart hydrogen fusion in their cores. This is when the nuclear fusion has just started and the star is slowly but surely collapsing in order to reach a hydrostatic equilibrium. Throughout this, the star becomes hotter, even whilst staying at a consistent luminosity. Stars that enter the Henyey track directly are known as [Herbig Ae/Be Stars](../../beginning/herbig-ae-be).


### Giants and Supergiants

Giants and Supergiants often tend to be red in color, which usually means their temperatures are very low. However, due to their relative sizes and radii, they shine much, **much** brighter than even some blue main sequence stars. [As we will later learn](../../giants/red_giant), Giants are mostly formed after a while of a main sequence star existing, and their masses are also much larger. Usually, these occur the most after main sequence stars, but due to their intense luminosities, the red giant stars are vaguely visible via the naked eye, which means a large proportion of stars we see in the sky are in fact red giants.

Here are some notable giants and supergiants you can find in the night sky:


### Dwarves

Dwarves don't commonly occur, since the universe isn't old enough for such dwarves to have been formed in large majority. However, their characteristic abnormality is their lowly radiative luminosity given their high temperatures. Here are some notable dwarf stars you may have heard of:

- Sirius B
- Procyon B
- 40 Eridani B

Notice that these stars are often the "B" star, which means secondary in the system. This is because they often orbit around a larger main sequence star which is the "A" star. We will read more about dwarves [later](../../dwarves/white_dwarf).
