However, most stars in the universe exist not as isolated stars, but as binaries, where two stars orbit their shared center of mass. When one of the stars in a binary system becomes a white dwarf, it forms what is known as a Binary White Dwarf System . Recap: White Dwarves Recall that a white dwarf is the result of the death of a low-mass star, where its gas envelope has been stripped away to leave only the carbon core at the center. Nuclear fusion no longer occurs within the core of the white dwarf and it glows its white color simply due to its remaining heat. When a red giant eventually forms a white dwarf, what remains is usually simply a husk that will slowly cool as it radiates its remaining heat, eventually forming a black dwarf. However, in a binary system, the white dwarf has the potential to evolve further -- and in far mmore spectacular ways. The Characteristics of Binary Systems In a binary system, the space around the system is affected by the gravitational pull of both stars. A common representation of this is each star being surrounded by its Roche lobe , a teardrop-shaped zone. Within the zone, the star's gravity dominates its partner's pull. The lobes of the two stars meet at a point between them known as the Lagrangian point , where the gravity of the two is balanced. Larger stars, owing to their stronger gravitational pull, have larger Roche lobes and further Lagrangian points along the line between the two. Stealing Gas In a binary white dwarf system, the white dwarf's gravitational field can begin to pull gas from its partner to itself -- in other words, the size of its partner exceeds their Roche lobe. The result is that the white dwarf slowly gains gas from its partner. This occurs most when its partner is also reaching the end of its main sequence and has expanded to a red giant, where it is much easier for the size of the partner to exceed their lobe. This process, where the white dwarf gradually gains mass from its partner, is known as accretion . Accretion Disks While the white dwarf attempts to pull mass from its partner straight towards itself, the spinning of the entire binary star system as well as the small size of the white dwarf makes it very easy for the mass to \"miss\" the white dwarf and go into orbit around it instead. A combination of tidal forces and the centripetal force from the gravitational pull stretches the gas into a thin, round layer surrounding the white dwarf, which is visible as an accretion disk . As gas particles in the swirling disk collide, they will lose energy and be unable to sustain their existing orbital position, falling towards the white dwarf's surface. As the gas falls, it heats up -- so hot that it begins to radiate with peak wavelengths in visible and even ultraviolet and X-ray ranges, radiating light that outshines the white dwarf itself. Gas Buildup, Novas and Supernovas As the gas accumulates on the white dwarf surface, it becomes hotter and denser as the pressure too increases. At a critical point, the hydrogen ignites and begins to fuse into helium, forming a nova . In an even more extreme case, the white dwarf gains so much mass that its gravity can no longer be balanced by the repulsion from its degenerate electrons, and the entire white dwarf collapses on itself and explodes in a Type Ia supernova .

Stargazers of ancient times believed that new stars were created, as the bursts of light seemed to appear from nowhere in the night sky -- hence their name nova , which means \"new\" in Latin. Astronomers today now know that novas are not, in fact, new stars, but rather white dwarves -- stars that have already reached the end of their main sequence and are now husks of mainly carbon and oxygen. Where does the light come from? White dwarves are stars that are \"dead\": nuclear fusion no longer occurs in them, and their faint white glow comes from the radiation they produce due to whatever temperature they have left. Obviously, the burst of light from a nova could not possibly come from within a single white dwarf without any other interference. In reality, novas cannot occur with any white dwarf, but rather only those that are in Binary White Dwarf Systems . In a binary white dwarf system, the white dwarf tends to attract gas from its partner to itself, which forms an accretion disk around the white dwarf. The accretion disk is very hot, and hence radiates in the visible spectrum -- most of the light visible from the white dwarf in a binary system comes not from the white dwarf itself but its accretion disk. Hydrogen Accumulation The gases in the accretion disk cannot keep on orbiting the white dwarf forever -- resistive forces caused by viscosity in the gas surrounding the white dwarf cause the gas to slow down and fall towards the white dwarf, eventually landing on its surface. As more gas builds up on the surface of the white dwarf, it gets hotter and denser. Eventually, the hydrogen gets hotter and hotter until reaching a critical point of about 20 million Kelvin, at which point the hydrogen ignites and begins to undergo nuclear fusion into helium. As a refresher, this nuclear reaction is exactly the same as the reaction that the cores of stars in their main sequence undergo to produce their energy. \\[ 4\\ce{^{1}_{1}H} + 2\\ce{^{0}_{-1}e} \\rightarrow \\ce{^{4}_{2}He} + 2\\nu \\] The fusion reaction releases a very large amount of energy, causing the hydrogen to heat up until it radiates in the visible range. The rapid heating causes the gas to expand rapidly, blowing most of it into space, where it then cools down. This is why novas flare up suddenly and then slowly fade back to their normal brightness. The Cycle Continues The gas from the nova is largely blasted off into space and the white dwarf cools back to its original temperature. This marks a return to the original binary white dwarf system, where the white dwarf can go nova again, or even turn into a Type Ia Supernova for an even more spectacular burst of light.

The accretion disk is very hot, and hence radiates in the visible spectrum -- most of the light visible from the white dwarf in a binary system comes not from the white dwarf itself but its accretion disk.","title":"Where does the light come from?"},{"location":"stellar/nova/nova/#hydrogen-accumulation","text":"The gases in the accretion disk cannot keep on orbiting the white dwarf forever -- resistive forces caused by viscosity in the gas surrounding the white dwarf cause the gas to slow down and fall towards the white dwarf, eventually landing on its surface. As more gas builds up on the surface of the white dwarf, it gets hotter and denser. Eventually, the hydrogen gets hotter and hotter until reaching a critical point of about 20 million Kelvin, at which point the hydrogen ignites and begins to undergo nuclear fusion into helium. As a refresher, this nuclear reaction is exactly the same as the reaction that the cores of stars in their main sequence undergo to produce their energy. \\[ 4\\ce{^{1}_{1}H} + 2\\ce{^{0}_{-1}e} \\rightarrow \\ce{^{4}_{2}He} + 2\\nu \\] The fusion reaction releases a very large amount of energy, causing the hydrogen to heat up until it radiates in the visible range. The rapid heating causes the gas to expand rapidly, blowing most of it into space, where it then cools down. This is why novas flare up suddenly and then slowly fade back to their normal brightness.","title":"Hydrogen Accumulation"},{"location":"stellar/nova/nova/#the-cycle-continues","text":"The gas from the nova is largely blasted off into space and the white dwarf cools back to its original temperature.

Supernovas, as one can tell from the name, obtain their name as they flare up suddenly like novas, but have even greater brightness than them. Despite their similar names oweing to the similar phenomenon at the surface level, the mechanisms behind supernovas actually are quite distinct from that of novas. Supernovas vs Novas Supernovas were not well-understood for a long time, with astronomers puzzled on what differentiated them with the similarly bright novas. In particular, the perplexing discovery of how supernovas only rose in brightness once before disappearing as opposed to the recurring flares of novas. However, with us now knowing more about the process of how supernovas explode, we now have a better understanding of how they differ. The reason for supernovas occuring only once is a direct result of the greater magnitude of their burst of brightness \u2014 the reaction responsible for this greater release in energy also causes the entire star to blow apart and violently explode, leaving no chance for a repeat performance. Types of Supernova Supernovas today are divided into two types, Type I and Type II, based on how much hydrogen they contain, deduced from the emission lines of their radiation. Type I supernovas are characterized by being hydrogen-poor, lacking the characteristic lines of the radiation hydrogen emits when heated, and has its brightness over time vary more similarly to that of a regular nova. Type I supernovas are also divided into further subtypes, Types Ia, Ib and Ic, depending on their cause. Types Ib and Ic occur due to the collapse of the core of a massive star, while Ia differs from them as it is the result of a binary white dwarf system. This article will focus on Type Ia Supernovas. Mass Accretion and Accumulation Recall that in a binary white dwarf system, the white dwarf will accrete mass from its partner when the partner expands past its own Roche lobe, allowing the white dwarf's gravitational pull to dominate and pull gas towards itself. When too much gas accumulates and pressure increases, the gas will tend to ignite in the form of a nova ; however with every nova flare not all the gas is consumed and more of it begins to accumulate. Thus, across multiple cycles, the mass of the white dwarf tends to increase. Balancing Pressures Opposing the gravity of the white dwarf trying to collapse in on itself is the electron degeneracy pressure . In the high-density conditions of white dwarves, the electrons are packed very closely together, but due to the quantum property of microstates, they are forced to stay a certain distance apart so they do not encroach on one another's microstates. This requirement results in an outward pressure that balances the gravitation. However, this pressure has a limit: if too much mass accumulates, the electron degeneracy pressure will no longer be able to support the gravitational force and the white dwarf will collapse. The mass at which this occurs is calculated to be about 1.4 solar masses, which is known as the Chandrasekhar mass or Chandrasekhar limit . The White Dwarf Collapses The collapsing white dwarf causes its core to be forced together again, creating an even stronger gravitational field that pulls on the matter comprising the white dwarf even more strongly. The result is that the pressures are high enough for the carbon core of the white dwarf to undergo carbon fusion , which is the same process of that in massive stars. Carbon fusion can yield multiple products, for example in the following: \\[$ \\ce{^{12}_{6}C} + \\ce{^{12}_{6}C} \\rightarrow \\ce{^{20}_{10}Ne} + \\ce{^{4}_{2}He} \\ce{^{12}_{6}C} + \\ce{^{12}_{6}C} \\rightarrow \\ce{^{23}_{11}Na} + \\ce{^{1}_{1}H} \\ce{^{12}_{6}C} + \\ce{^{12}_{6}C} \\rightarrow \\ce{^{23}_{12}Mg} + \\ce{^{1}_{0}n} $\\] This process generates a huge amount of energy as practically the whole star undergoes fusion at once. This burst of energy overcomes the gravitational pull of the white dwarf's matter, and the white dwarf explodes in a large conflagaration that also releases a large amount of light, which we observe as a Type Ia Supernova .

Let's start by exploring the history of this diagram. History The HR Diagram was the brainchild of its namesake, Danish astronomer Ejnar Hertzsprung (1873 - 1967) and American astronomer Henry Norris Russell (1877 - 1957). It was developed independently by both astronomers, in 1911 and 1914 respectively. The original HR Diagram was completely different from that pictured in Figure 1.2.1 . It looked a lot more than what is shown below: Figure 1.2.2: The Original HR Diagram (from Rochester Institute of Technology ) Notice that the y-axis is the Absolute Visual Magnitude, while the x-axis is populated by letters. These are Spectral Classes. Let's get into them. Star Classification Spectral Classes Spectral Classes are used to distinguish between different types of stars, based off color, temperature and other factors. The main factor is essentially the ionisatiom state of the star, although it can just be subtended to the surface temperature of the star. Specifically in the Morgan-Keenan Classification System of classification, which is the standard and was also used by both astronomers, we classify from O, B, A, F, G, K and M. As we go down the list, the temperature of the star decreases. Often, to abbreviate, we use the following pneumonics: \" O h, B e A F ine G irl, K M e\" \" O h B oy, A n F G rade K ills M e\" \" O bama B ought A F reaking G iant K illing M achine\" We often divide the spectral classes into 10 subdivisions, numerically from 0-9 . As this number decreases, the stars that occur become hotter. Thus, O0 is the hottest and M9 is the coldest. To summarise with examples, here's a helpful table! Class Color Surface Temperature (K) Example Actual Class O Blue \\(30,000 - 60,000\\) Mintaka Aa1 O9 B Blue-White \\(10,000 - 30,000\\) Rigel B8 A White \\(7500 - 10,000\\) Vega ( A0 ), Sirius ( A1 ) F Yellow-White \\(6000 - 7500\\) Canopus F0 G Yellow \\(5000 - 6000\\) Sun, Alpha Centauri G2 K Orange \\(3500 - 5000\\) Arcturus ( K2 ), Aldebaran ( K5 ) M Red \\(< 3500\\) Betelgeuse ( M2 ), Barnard's Star ( M5 ) If the star is even warmer than the \\(60,000\\text{ K}\\) , there is a special class known as the W class, which describes extremely hot and bluish stars known as Wolf-Rayet stars. On the other hand. Brown Dwarves are known to fall into a class lower than M. Luminosity Classes The Morgan-Keenan Classification System also accounts for stars of specific luminosities. Luminosity Class Star Type Example I Supergiants Betelgeuse (Red Supergiant) II Bright Giants III Giants IV Sub Giants V Main Sequence Stars Sun Main Sequence is the main class where most stars fall, such as our Sun. Stellar Spectra (Graphs) The following is a representation of the Stellar Spectra, broken down by the Spectral and Luminosity Classes as stated above. (Try clicking on one of the tabs, and just shifting your arrow keys. It looks quite cool!) O9V B3V B8V A0V A3V A7V F2V F8V G2V G8V K2V K7V M2V M6V Notes : This data comes from the stellar spectra library described by A.J. Pickles (Proc. Ast. Soc. Pacific, 1998). These spectra are not displayed on a fixed intensity scale. The height of each spectrum is stretched to fill the display. To display a different spectrum, click a button on the left. By default, the spectrum of a G2V star like the Sun is shown. To measure the wavelength of a feature in the spectrum, click or click-and-drag. The wavelength is shown at the bottom of the display. For reference, visible light ranges from 400 to 700 nanometers. Ultraviolet is shorter in wavelength, infrared is longer. The Modern HR Diagram The diagram looks as such Figure 1.2.3: The Actual HR Diagram (From the ESA/HIPPARCOS Mission) Key Features The Key Features of the HR Diagram is as follows: Vertical Axis is some variant of the Luminosity, \\(L\\) or Absolute Visual Magnitude, \\(M\\) . As we learnt in The Magnitude Scale , Absolute Visual Magnitude is a scaled form of \\(log L\\) . This can cause the plot to look slightly different, but it's mostly standard. Horizontal Axis is Temperature, but note , the axis is flipped. This means that as we go the right of the diagram, the temperature is in fact decreasing. The shape on the graph is largely predicated on what stars you identify, but most stars, as mentioned before, fall into the main sequence , the long line spanning the top left to bottom right of the graph. For the sake of this discussion, let's briefly go through each type of star. Main Sequence The behaviour of the main sequence stars is aptly describe by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states \\[L = Ae\\sigma T^4\\] Based of the above rule, we've been able to gether that stars with higher temperatures largely shine brighter. It is crucial to note that \\(T\\) is scaled up via the significant exponent, that being \"4\". Hence most stars do operate based on this logic. For instance, here is a diagram I've plotted to show the relation: Figure 1.2.4: A plot of the possible pattern of main sequence stars. This assumes R is on a exponentiated normal distribution about the radius of the Sun, and T is varied on the given list.

Stars often spend billions and billions of years in this class, before it moves on to others. Main Sequence is the ideal scenario, but when we approach stranger masses, we get peculiar patterns. Let's go into them. Giants and Supergiants Giants and Supergiants often tend to be red in color, which usually means their temperatures are very low. However, due to their relative sizes and radii, they shine much, much brighter than even some blue main sequence stars. As we will later learn , Giants are mostly formed after a while of a main sequence star existing, and their masses are also much larger. Usually, these occur the most after main sequence stars, but due to their intense luminosities, the red giant stars are vaguely visible via the naked eye, which means a large proportion of stars we see in the sky are in fact red giants. Here are some notable giants and supergiants you can find in the night sky: Star Classification Arcturus Giant Aldebaran Giant Antares Supergiant Betelgeuse Supergiant Dwarves Dwarves don't commonly occur, since the universe isn't old enough for such dwarves to have been formed in large majority. However, their characteristic abnormality is their lowly radiative luminosity given their high temperatures. Here are some notable dwarf stars you may have heard of: Sirius B Procyon B 40 Eridani B Notice that these stars are often the \"B\" star, which means secondary in the system. This is because they often orbit around a larger main sequence star which is the \"A\" star. We will read more about dwarves later . Key Variations of the Diagram Color Magnitude Diagrams Color Magnitude Diagrams are another way of approaching HR Diagrams. They are slightly varied, for instance using Magnitude instead of Luminosity, and \"Color\" instead of Temperature. Figure 1.2.5: A Color Magnitude Diagram based on the Data from the Gaia Early Data Release 3 (eDR3), specifically pertaining to the M67 Cluster as obtained via the HDBScan algorithm (Data Courtesy of the Gaia Early Data Release 3) Why was the above done? This work was done as part of the Astrochallenge 2022 Data Analysis Question. As you can see, most of the features commonly associated with the HR Diagram, like the Supergiants and Dwarves and more, are missing, but why? This is mainly caused by the fact that M67 is a cluster that holds mostly stars that would have been created via the same molecular cloud. This means that their compositions and sizes are likely to be the same, other than perhaps some stars that have slowly edges towards giants, causing a slight movement. However, something that was strangely found was that if you actually obtained the entire Color Magnitude Diagram in the direction of M67, we would get a huge, HUGE patch underneath the main sequence line. Figure 1.2.6: The Actual Color Magnitude Diagram based on the Data from the Gaia Early Data Release 3 (eDR3), in the direction of the M67 Cluster. Highlighted in Blue is the M67 Color Magnitude Diagram as in Figure 1.2.5 (Data Courtesy of the Gaia Early Data Release 3) The reason for this is that not all of these are moving away at precisely the same speeds, whereas based on our current understanding of cosmology, the cluster itself moves slowly but roughly at the same speed away from us. This was in fact how we obtained the M67 cluster from the data, which is pretty cool. The XKCD Cut The person from XKCD developed an amazing image illustrating an \"expanded\" version on the HR Diagram in Figure 1.2.1. See below: The \"Expanded\" Hertzprung Russell Diagram (Brought to you by XKCD ) The Hayashi Track The Hayashi Track is the almost vertical \"path\" that protostars (with masses less than \\(3 M_\\odot\\) ) take down the HR diagram. It represents the gravitational collapse of T Tauri stars , the collapsing star becomes less luminous because as the star contracts, there is less area available for the star to emit light. The Forbidden Zone \ud83d\udc80 Add something here later The Henyey Track The Henyey Track is a the almost horizontal \"path\" to the main sequence that stars take after the hayashi track, or right as they form if they have sufficient mass kickstart hydrogen fusion in their cores.

This work was done as part of the Astrochallenge 2022 Data Analysis Question. As you can see, most of the features commonly associated with the HR Diagram, like the Supergiants and Dwarves and more, are missing, but why? This is mainly caused by the fact that M67 is a cluster that holds mostly stars that would have been created via the same molecular cloud. This means that their compositions and sizes are likely to be the same, other than perhaps some stars that have slowly edges towards giants, causing a slight movement. However, something that was strangely found was that if you actually obtained the entire Color Magnitude Diagram in the direction of M67, we would get a huge, HUGE patch underneath the main sequence line.

The understand the Magnitude System, we must first start by discussing the historical significance of the system. Hipparchus and the Greek Observation Hipparchus of Nicea (190 BC - 120 BC) was one of the many astronomers in the time of the Greeks, and influenced much of what we understand of astronomy today. What sets him apart is he is still considered, to this date, the greatest astronomical observer in history. His work on star catalogs, spherical trigonometry and more still astounds astronomers working today, but what we want to focus on today is his work on the Magnitude Scale. Prior to Hipparchus, most Greek astronomers believed that a star's brightness is only based on its size, which we now know is in fact false. There are many factors in play here, and we needed to spend more time analysing it. Then Hipparchus himself came to the scene. As perhaps the greatest anicient astronomer, he used his ingenuity to group stars up into specific classes based on their perceived brightness. He assigned discrete integer values to each star, such that the brightest stars would fall into the \"Stars of the First Magnitude\" and the barely visible stars were allocated to the \"Stars of the Sixth Magnitude\" . The problem with this system was unfortunately the fact that just plain observation is incredibly subjective, since stars often vary in brightness. However, this set the seedling for what was yet to come... Pogson's Law In 1856, an Astronomer working at Oxford University by the name of Norman Pogson came up with an efficient scale to work with the preset definitions from Hipparchus. He believed that our observation and hence tabulation of the magnitudes of different stars was influenced by a Logarithmic Scale. However, it wasn't purely based on a logarithmic scale in the conventional sense. Scaling and done to ensure that a simple step-down of 5 steps of magnitude would entail the star being about a hundred times brighter. To visualise, it would be something like this: \\[ \\frac{F}{F_\\text{ref}} = 100^{(m_\\text{ref} - m)/5} \\] or in other words: \\[ m = m_\\text{ref} + 2.5 \\log \\left(\\frac{F_\\text{ref}}{F}\\right) \\] Where we have that \\(F\\) and \\(m\\) are the flux (as intensity) and magnitude (as a decimal value). We have to base it off the referential object, reprsented by the \\(\\text{ref}\\) keyword. This is known as Pogson's Law , an incredibly important theorem in the field of stellar astronomy and observational astronomy. We can use this for comparisons between different variables or simply for identifying the magnitude/flux of the object to be observed. Ideally, if the value of \\(m\\) is larger than 6, we can just say that the object is invisible in the night sky via the use of the naked eye, although using traditional telescopes or even high-powered space-based observatories like the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), we can identify much, MUCH fainter stars, which is truly extraordinary. Noticeably, this result can be simplfied by essentially modifying to base of the exponent to be \\(100^{1/5} \\approx 2.512\\) instead of just \\(100\\) . Generally however, sticking to \\(100\\) is better for achieving a value closer to the actual value. However Reference Points For the most part, astronomers used to use Polaris (the North Star) as a reference, defining its magnitude as about \\(+2.0\\) . However, it was later found that Polaris was a variable star, which essentially means that its brightness would vary with time. We eventually moved to Vega, another star whose brightness was believed to be about \\(+0.0\\) (the actual value was in fact \\(+0.026\\) ). However, recent studies have shown that Vega is also variable, although we have not yet identified the next best reference point. However, for a better compilation, we can list the following samples: Reference Point Reference \\(m\\) Reference Point Reference \\(m\\) Sun -26.74 Full Moon -12.7 Venus -4.5 Jupiter -2.5 Saturn +0.7 Sirius -1.46 Canopus -0.72 Alpha Centauri -0.01 Arcturus -0.04 Vega +0.026 Capella +0.08 Rigel +0.18 Procyon +0.34 Achernar +0.50 Polaris +1.97 Looking through this expansive list, we are able to identify some key sources. We have the brightest planets in the night sky, namely Venus, Jupiter and Saturn. Sirius is the brightest star in the night sky, and Alpha Centauri is the closest star to our solar system beyond, of course, our Sun. The Fundamental Flaw with \\(m\\) As you've seen, we've used \\(m\\) here to represent the visual magnitude, but this is in fact the apparent visual magnitude. The readings in the above system only match up based on a specifc common origin, which in this case is the earth. However, at other points, this same visual perception would be vastly different. For a simple set-up, consider viewing the Sun from the Earth and Saturn, as shown in the diagram below. Figure 1.1.1: Comparison of Luminosities of the Sun from Earth and Saturn It is a noticeable difference, and it is also apparent in the values for \\(F\\) . Based on our understanding of flux intensity, we have the following: \\[ F = \\frac{P}{A} = \\frac{L}{4\\pi R^2} \\] This means that at further distances, the flux decreases. Hence the value for \\(m\\) at Saturn will NOT be \\(-26.74\\) . This poses an important issue in the face of astronomers, and they have come up with two different ways to fix this, namely the following: Scaling based on Distance Establishing a Universal Standard Let's cover both of them. Relating to Distance Considering the same flux equation above, we can easily extrapolate the following relation for the same star from varied distances: \\[ \\begin{align*} F_1 &= \\frac{L}{4\\pi R_1^2} \\\\ F_2 &= \\frac{L}{4\\pi R_2^2} \\\\ \\frac{F_1}{F_2} &= 100^{(m_2 - m_1)/5} \\\\ \\frac{\\frac{L}{4\\pi R_1^2}}{\\frac{L}{4\\pi R_2^2}} &= 100^{(m_2 - m_1)/5} \\\\ \\frac{R_2}{R_1} &= 10^{(m_2 - m_1)/5} \\\\ m_2 - m_1 &= 5 \\log \\left(\\frac{R_2}{R_1} \\right) \\end{align*} \\] This can be used easily to scale the magnitude. For instance, if the object is brought ten times closer, the new magnitude is 5 times larger. We also see that magnitude increases with increases distance, so for some arbitrary point.

This system was defined based on a referential distance, that is to say that the absolute magnitude, \\(M\\) would occur at that specific distance from any given object. This distance was 10 parsecs . For the sake of this context, let a parsec ( \\(\\text{pc}\\) ) be a given unit of measurement, similar to a lightyear or AU. By definition, \\(1\\text{ pc} = 3.086 \\times 10^{16}\\text{ m} = 3.262\\text{ ly}\\) . Hence we had the following equation: \\[m - M = 5 \\log \\left(\\frac{R}{10 \\text{ pc} } \\right)\\] Of course, if this wasn't enough, Astronmers have an interesting term for the Left-Hand Side of the above Equation, \\(\\mu = m - M\\) . This value is known as the distance modulus , since it is only really affected by the distance from the given object. We often use \\(M\\) instead so that we can get an accurate perception of a given star, and this comes in handy with stellar evolution. Notably, if we were to represent \\(R\\) in parsecs, we have the following: \\[M = m + 5 - 5\\log R\\] This is useful since the distance in parsecs is also known as the parallax of any given object, \\(\\pi\\) . Hence, \\[M = m + 5 - 5\\log \\pi\\] For instance, the absolute magnitude of the Sun is given by \\(+4.83\\) . Fun Questions A Triple Star System Question Solution (a) Solution (b) Solution (c) A Triple Star System is defined for where three stars move around another in a consistent eclipse. Most stable triple star systems involve a faraway star influencing an eclipsing binary star system. Let's assume, for the sake of this discussion, that this oscillating system is observed in the eclipsing pattern, that is to say that they move along a singular planar line with reference from the earth. Thus, while in reality, the situation is very much as shown in the below image: However, from Earth, the view would be more so as shown in the diagram below: Assuming that these are identical stars and hence emit identical luminosities, and assuming that the nearest point for the independent teritiary or the binary star system (which you can treat as a singular entity) is given by a distance variable \\(R\\) , and the radius of the circular orbit is of radius \\(\\frac{R}{2}\\) , derive the magnitudes of the Eclipsing Binary (EB) and Tertiary Candidate (TC) when: the tertiary candidate is furthest. the tertiary candidate is closest. the tertiary candidate and eclipsing binary are equidistant from the Earth Assume that for overlap, no light is blocked (unrealistic circumstance). Leave your answer in terms of the absolute magnitude of any one of the given stars, \\(M\\) , and \\(R\\) . For Part (a), let's visualise the solution as below: This is a pretty interesting solution. First, let's start by obtaining the visual magnitude of the tertiary candidate (TC) and the eclipsing binary (EB). \\[ \\begin{align*} m_\\text{TC} &= M_\\text{TC} + 5 \\log \\left(\\frac{2R}{10 \\text{ pc} } \\right) \\\\ m_\\text{EB} &= M_\\text{EB} + 5 \\log \\left(\\frac{R}{10 \\text{ pc} } \\right) \\end{align*} \\] We can arbitrate \\(M_\\text{TC}\\) to be \\(M\\) , the absolute magnitude of any of the given stars. As for \\(M_\\text{EB}\\) , we must use Flux to conclude what the value for this is. Since the two stars in the eclipsing binary are effectively identical, the flux from both stars can be represented as a variable \\(F\\) . Thus: \\[ \\begin{align*} M_\\text{EB} &= M + \\log \\left(\\frac{F}{F_\\text{EB} } \\right) \\\\ &= M - \\log 2 \\end{align*} \\] Thus, we have the following: \\[ \\begin{align*} m_\\text{TC} &= M + 5\\log 2 + 5 \\log \\left(\\frac{R}{10 \\text{ pc} } \\right) \\\\ m_\\text{EB} &= M - \\log 2 + 5 \\log \\left(\\frac{R}{10 \\text{ pc} } \\right) \\end{align*} \\] For Part (b), let's visualise the solution as below: This is a pretty interesting solution. First, let's start by obtaining the visual magnitude of the tertiary candidate (TC) and the eclipsing binary (EB). \\[ \\begin{align*} m_\\text{TC} &= M_\\text{TC} + 5 \\log \\left(\\frac{R}{10 \\text{ pc} } \\right) \\\\ m_\\text{EB} &= M_\\text{EB} + 5 \\log \\left(\\frac{2R}{10 \\text{ pc} } \\right) \\end{align*} \\] We can arbitrate \\(M_\\text{TC}\\) to be \\(M\\) , the absolute magnitude of any of the given stars. As for \\(M_\\text{EB}\\) , from Part (a), \\[M_\\text{EB} = M - \\log 2\\] Thus, we have the following: \\[ \\begin{align*} m_\\text{TC} &= M + 5 \\log \\left(\\frac{R}{10 \\text{ pc} } \\right) \\\\ m_\\text{EB} &= M - \\log 2 + 5\\log 2 + 5 \\log \\left(\\frac{R}{10 \\text{ pc} } \\right) \\\\ &= M + 4\\log 2 + 5 \\log \\left(\\frac{R}{10 \\text{ pc} } \\right) \\end{align*} \\] For Part (c), let's visualise the solution as below: This is a pretty interesting solution. First, let's start by obtaining the visual magnitude of the tertiary candidate (TC) and the eclipsing binary (EB). \\[ \\begin{align*} m_\\text{TC} &= M_\\text{TC} + 5 \\log \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{10} }{2}\\frac{R}{10 \\text{ pc} } \\right) \\\\ m_\\text{EB} &= M_\\text{EB} + 5 \\log \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{10} }{2}\\frac{R}{10 \\text{ pc} } \\right) \\end{align*} \\] We can arbitrate \\(M_\\text{TC}\\) to be \\(M\\) , the absolute magnitude of any of the given stars.

Most stable triple star systems involve a faraway star influencing an eclipsing binary star system. Let's assume, for the sake of this discussion, that this oscillating system is observed in the eclipsing pattern, that is to say that they move along a singular planar line with reference from the earth. Thus, while in reality, the situation is very much as shown in the below image: However, from Earth, the view would be more so as shown in the diagram below: Assuming that these are identical stars and hence emit identical luminosities, and assuming that the nearest point for the independent teritiary or the binary star system (which you can treat as a singular entity) is given by a distance variable \\(R\\) , and the radius of the circular orbit is of radius \\(\\frac{R}{2}\\) , derive the magnitudes of the Eclipsing Binary (EB) and Tertiary Candidate (TC) when: the tertiary candidate is furthest. the tertiary candidate is closest. the tertiary candidate and eclipsing binary are equidistant from the Earth Assume that for overlap, no light is blocked (unrealistic circumstance). Leave your answer in terms of the absolute magnitude of any one of the given stars, \\(M\\) , and \\(R\\) . For Part (a), let's visualise the solution as below: This is a pretty interesting solution.

As for \\(M_\\text{EB}\\) , we must use Flux to conclude what the value for this is. Since the two stars in the eclipsing binary are effectively identical, the flux from both stars can be represented as a variable \\(F\\) .

Caution Be sure to read stellar structure before proceeding with this one The Proton-Proton Chain The proton-proton chain (or pp-chain ) is the main mechanism that converts hydrogen into helium-4 in the cores of low-mass stars. In doing so, energy is released which fuels the star. There are three branches of the pp-chain. However, they all start with the same two steps, the production of deuterium and helium-3 $$ ^1_1\\text{H} + ^1_1\\text{H}\\rightarrow\\ ^2_1\\text{H} + e^+ + \\nu_e $$ $$ ^2_1\\text{H} + ^1_1\\text{H}\\rightarrow\\ ^3_2\\text{He} + \\gamma $$ PP I branch This branch is the most typical branch that occurs for a pp-chain .

In the Sun We include the following nice diagram from Bradley's Introduction to Modern Astronomy which illustrates the branches along with their probability of occuring in the sun Temperature Requirement For a pp-chain to occur, the colliding nuclei must overcome the electrostatic repulsion between them to get into the regime of the strong nuclear force , whereby the nuclei fuses, we call this energy barrier the Coulomb barrier . Classically, we would expect only nuclei that possesses kinetic energy that surpasses that of the Coulomb barrier to react. In which case, considering the reduced mass \\(\\mu\\) of two colliding particles give $$ \\frac{1}{2}\\mu \\overline v_{rel}^2 = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\frac{q_1q_2}{r} \\Rightarrow \\frac{3}{2}kT = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\frac{q_1q_2}{r} $$ $$ \\Rightarrow T = \\frac{1}{6\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\frac{q_1q_2}{rk}\\approx 10^{10}\\quad \\text{(for the sun)} $$ However, from experimental observation, we find that pp-chain still happen in stars that operate at a temperatures much lower than this, for example our sun has a core temperature of \\(\\approx 1.57\\times10^{7} < 10^{10}\\) . This is because, in real life, quantum effects allows the nuclei to quantum tunnel through the Coulomb barrier, resulting in a much lower required temperature of $$ T = \\frac{q_1^2q_2^2\\mu}{12\\pi^2\\epsilon_0^2h^2k} $$ where - \\(\\mu\\) is the reduced mass - \\(\\epsilon_0\\) is vaccuum permittivity - \\(h\\) is the Planck constant - \\(k\\) is the Boltzmann constant For context, this temperature comes out to \\(\\approx 10^7\\) for the sun, which agrees with our observations. Main-Sequence Evolution As the pp-chain burns away hydrogen, the mean molecular weight of the core increases as we have substituted 4 lighter nucleus for 1 heavier nucleus. The mean molecular weight \\(\\mu\\) is defined as $$ \\mu = \\frac{\\overline m}{m_H} $$ where - \\(\\overline m\\) is the average nuclear mass in the star - \\(m_H\\) is the mass of a hydrogen atom. We know that the pressure at the core of the star is due to a combination of gas and radiation pressure, which is given by the hydrostatic pressure equation $$ P = \\frac{\\rho kT}{\\mu m_H} + \\frac{1}{3}aT^4 $$ $$ \\Rightarrow P \\approx \\frac{\\rho kT}{\\mu m_H}\\quad \\text{(at low temperatures)} $$ where - \\(\\rho\\) is the density of the star - \\(k\\) is the Boltzmann constant - \\(T\\) is the temperature - \\(\\mu\\) is the mean molecular weight - \\(m_H\\) is the mass of a hydrogen atom We also know that a star exists in a state of hydrostatic equlibrium where the pressure inside the star fight against the gravitational collapse of the star. From the pressure equation , we see that as the mean molecular weight of the star increases the pressure will tend to decrease. As such, in order to maintain the pressure such that it can still support the weight of the star, either the density \\(\\rho\\) or the temperature \\(T\\) , or both must increase to compensate for the increase in \\(\\mu\\) . In this case both will increase in the following fashion. The decreased hydrostatic pressure becomes insufficient to fight against the gravitational collapse, thus the core compresses. As the core compresses the density \\(\\rho\\) is increased . Furthermore, this compression results in gravitational potential energy being released. By virial theorem , only half of the gravitational energy will be released in the form of radiation, with the other half being absorbed as heat which will increase the temperature \\(T\\) of the star. Now as the temperature is increased, there will be more parts of the star that reaches the [[#Temperature Requirement|temperature required]] to initiate hydrogen fusion, this causes there to be more pp-chain reaction . Furthermore, the rate at which the pp-chain occurs is also increased as $$ \\text{rate of pp reaction} \\propto \\rho\\mathcal X^2T^4 $$ where - \\(\\rho\\) is the density - \\(\\mathcal X\\) is the mole fraction of hydrogen - \\(T\\) is the temperature Hence, more energy is produced per unit time and the power delivery of the star increases, causing it to shine brighter . Leaving the Main-Sequence Eventually, the hydrogen at the core will be depleted , in which case the core will stop burning hydrogen and the core contracts due to gravitational collapse. This releases gravitational energy which heats up the outer envelope, which still contained hydrogen, causing hydrogen burning to resume. This continued hydrogen burning of the outer envelope causes the luminosity of the star to continue to rise . Furthermore, some of the energy generated by the envelope goes back into heating itself which causes it to further expand. The ash from the hydrogen burning in the envelope goes into increasing the mass of the helium core . Eventually the envelope of the star grows and cools sufficiently to become convective, in which case it has reached the Red Giant Phase Next: Red Giant The Sch\u00f6nberg\u2013Chandrasekhar Limit The Sch\u00f6nberg\u2013Chandrasekhar limit (SC limit) decribes the maximum ratio of core mass to star mass whereby the star is still able to support itself, it is given by $$ \\frac{M_{ic}}{M} = 0.37\\left(\\frac{\\mu_{env}}{\\mu_{ic}}\\right)^2 $$ where - \\(M_{ic}\\) is the mass of the core - \\(M\\) is the mass of the star - \\(\\mu_{env}\\) is the mean molecular weight of the envelope - \\(\\mu_{ic}\\) is the mean molecular weight of the core Exceeding the SC Limit Note, however, that the SC limit can be exceeded if there is another source of pressure supporting the weight of the star, aside from gas and radiation pressure. This can occur in the star if the electrons in the gas become degenerate , which happens when the gas density is so high that the electrons are forced to occupy the lowest possible energy state . However, due to Pauli's exclusion principle , which forbids electrons from occupying the same quantum state, the electrons will be stacked on progressively higher energy levels. This results in a sort of non-thermal electron degeneracy pressure which pushes against the gravitional collapse and allowing the star to exceed the Sch\u00f6nberg\u2013Chandrasekhar limit Questions! :) Question 1: Low-Mass Stars a) Are the cores of low-mass stars convective or radiative? b) What does it mean for a core to be convective? c) What does it mean for a core to be radiative?
