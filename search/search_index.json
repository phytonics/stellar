However, most stars in the universe exist not as isolated stars, but as binaries, where two stars orbit their shared center of mass. When one of the stars in a binary system becomes a white dwarf, it forms what is known as a Binary White Dwarf System . Recap: White Dwarves Recall that a white dwarf is the result of the death of a low-mass star, where its gas envelope has been stripped away to leave only the carbon core at the center. Nuclear fusion no longer occurs within the core of the white dwarf and it glows its white color simply due to its remaining heat. When a red giant eventually forms a white dwarf, what remains is usually simply a husk that will slowly cool as it radiates its remaining heat, eventually forming a black dwarf. However, in a binary system, the white dwarf has the potential to evolve further -- and in far mmore spectacular ways. The Characteristics of Binary Systems In a binary system, the space around the system is affected by the gravitational pull of both stars. A common representation of this is each star being surrounded by its Roche lobe , a teardrop-shaped zone. Within the zone, the star's gravity dominates its partner's pull. The lobes of the two stars meet at a point between them known as the Lagrangian point , where the gravity of the two is balanced. Larger stars, owing to their stronger gravitational pull, have larger Roche lobes and further Lagrangian points along the line between the two. (image placeholder) Stealing Gas In a binary white dwarf system, the white dwarf's gravitational field can begin to pull gas from its partner to itself -- in other words, the size of its partner exceeds their Roche lobe. The result is that the white dwarf slowly accrues gas from its partner. (image placeholder) This process, where the white dwarf gradually gains mass from its partner, is known as accretion . Accretion Disks While the white dwarf attempts to pull mass from its partner straight towards itself, the spinning of the entire binary star system as well as the small size of the white dwarf makes it very easy for the mass to \"miss\" the white dwarf and go into orbit around it instead. A combination of tidal forces and the centripetal force from the gravitational pull stretches the gas into a thin, round layer surrounding the white dwarf, which is visible as an accretion disk . (image placeholder) As gas particles in the swirling disk collide, they will lose energy and be unable to sustain their existing orbital position, falling slowly towards the white dwarf until they fall onto the surface. Gas Buildup, Novas and Supernovas As the gas accumulates on the white dwarf surface, it becomes hotter and denser as the pressure too increases. At a critical point, the hydrogen ignites and begins to fuse into helium, forming a nova . In an even more extreme case, the white dwarf gains so much mass that its gravity can no longer be balanced by the repulsion from its degenerate electrons, and the entire white dwarf collapses on itself and explodes in a Type Ia supernova .

What sets him apart is he is still considered, to this date, the greatest astronomical observer in history. His work on star catalogs, spherical trigonometry and more still astounds astronomers working today, but what we want to focus on today is his work on the Magnitude Scale.

However, it wasn't purely based on a logarithmic scale in the conventional sense.
