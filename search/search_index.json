However, most stars in the universe exist not as isolated stars, but as binaries, where two stars orbit their shared center of mass. When one of the stars in a binary system becomes a white dwarf, it forms what is known as a Binary White Dwarf System . Recap: White Dwarves Recall that a white dwarf is the result of the death of a low-mass star, where its gas envelope has been stripped away to leave only the carbon core at the center. Nuclear fusion no longer occurs within the core of the white dwarf and it glows its white color simply due to its remaining heat. When a red giant eventually forms a white dwarf, what remains is usually simply a husk that will slowly cool as it radiates its remaining heat, eventually forming a black dwarf. However, in a binary system, the white dwarf has the potential to evolve further -- and in far mmore spectacular ways. The Characteristics of Binary Systems In a binary system, the space around the system is affected by the gravitational pull of both stars. A common representation of this is each star being surrounded by its Roche lobe , a teardrop-shaped zone. Within the zone, the star's gravity dominates its partner's pull. The lobes of the two stars meet at a point between them known as the Lagrangian point , where the gravity of the two is balanced. Larger stars, owing to their stronger gravitational pull, have larger Roche lobes and further Lagrangian points along the line between the two. Stealing Gas In a binary white dwarf system, the white dwarf's gravitational field can begin to pull gas from its partner to itself -- in other words, the size of its partner exceeds their Roche lobe. The result is that the white dwarf slowly gains gas from its partner. This occurs most when its partner is also reaching the end of its main sequence and has expanded to a red giant, where it is much easier for the size of the partner to exceed their lobe. This process, where the white dwarf gradually gains mass from its partner, is known as accretion . Accretion Disks While the white dwarf attempts to pull mass from its partner straight towards itself, the spinning of the entire binary star system as well as the small size of the white dwarf makes it very easy for the mass to \"miss\" the white dwarf and go into orbit around it instead. A combination of tidal forces and the centripetal force from the gravitational pull stretches the gas into a thin, round layer surrounding the white dwarf, which is visible as an accretion disk . As gas particles in the swirling disk collide, they will lose energy and be unable to sustain their existing orbital position, falling towards the white dwarf's surface. As the gas falls, it heats up -- so hot that it begins to radiate with peak wavelengths in visible and even ultraviolet and X-ray ranges, radiating light that outshines the white dwarf itself. Gas Buildup, Novas and Supernovas As the gas accumulates on the white dwarf surface, it becomes hotter and denser as the pressure too increases. At a critical point, the hydrogen ignites and begins to fuse into helium, forming a nova . In an even more extreme case, the white dwarf gains so much mass that its gravity can no longer be balanced by the repulsion from its degenerate electrons, and the entire white dwarf collapses on itself and explodes in a Type Ia supernova .

Stargazers of ancient times believed that new stars were created, as the bursts of light seemed to appear from nowhere in the night sky -- hence their name nova , which means \"new\" in Latin. Astronomers today now know that novas are not, in fact, new stars, but rather white dwarves -- stars that have already reached the end of their main sequence and are now husks of mainly carbon and oxygen. Where does the light come from? White dwarves are stars that are \"dead\": nuclear fusion no longer occurs in them, and their faint white glow comes from the radiation they produce due to whatever temperature they have left. Obviously, the burst of light from a nova could not possibly come from within a single white dwarf without any other interference. In reality, novas cannot occur with any white dwarf, but rather only those that are in Binary White Dwarf Systems . In a binary white dwarf system, the white dwarf tends to attract gas from its partner to itself, which forms an accretion disk around the white dwarf. The accretion disk is very hot, and hence radiates in the visible spectrum -- most of the light visible from the white dwarf in a binary system comes not from the white dwarf itself but its accretion disk. Hydrogen Accumulation The gases in the accretion disk cannot keep on orbiting the white dwarf forever -- resistive forces caused by viscosity in the gas surrounding the white dwarf cause the gas to slow down and fall towards the white dwarf, eventually landing on its surface. As more gas builds up on the surface of the white dwarf, it gets hotter and denser. Eventually, the hydrogen gets hotter and hotter until reaching a critical point of about 20 million Kelvin, at which point the hydrogen ignites and begins to undergo nuclear fusion into helium. As a refresher, this nuclear reaction is exactly the same as the reaction that the cores of stars in their main sequence undergo to produce their energy. \\[ 4\\ce{^{1}_{1}H} + 2\\ce{^{0}_{-1}e} \\rightarrow \\ce{^{4}_{2}He} + 2\\nu \\] The fusion reaction releases a very large amount of energy, causing the hydrogen to heat up until it radiates in the visible range. The rapid heating causes the gas to expand rapidly, blowing most of it into space, where it then cools down. This is why novas flare up suddenly and then slowly fade back to their normal brightness. The Cycle Continues The gas from the nova is largely blasted off into space and the white dwarf cools back to its original temperature. This marks a return to the original binary white dwarf system, where the white ddwarf can go nova again, or even turn into a Type Ia Supernova for an even more spectacular burst of light.

The accretion disk is very hot, and hence radiates in the visible spectrum -- most of the light visible from the white dwarf in a binary system comes not from the white dwarf itself but its accretion disk.","title":"Where does the light come from?"},{"location":"stellar/nova/nova/#hydrogen-accumulation","text":"The gases in the accretion disk cannot keep on orbiting the white dwarf forever -- resistive forces caused by viscosity in the gas surrounding the white dwarf cause the gas to slow down and fall towards the white dwarf, eventually landing on its surface. As more gas builds up on the surface of the white dwarf, it gets hotter and denser. Eventually, the hydrogen gets hotter and hotter until reaching a critical point of about 20 million Kelvin, at which point the hydrogen ignites and begins to undergo nuclear fusion into helium. As a refresher, this nuclear reaction is exactly the same as the reaction that the cores of stars in their main sequence undergo to produce their energy. \\[ 4\\ce{^{1}_{1}H} + 2\\ce{^{0}_{-1}e} \\rightarrow \\ce{^{4}_{2}He} + 2\\nu \\] The fusion reaction releases a very large amount of energy, causing the hydrogen to heat up until it radiates in the visible range. The rapid heating causes the gas to expand rapidly, blowing most of it into space, where it then cools down. This is why novas flare up suddenly and then slowly fade back to their normal brightness.","title":"Hydrogen Accumulation"},{"location":"stellar/nova/nova/#the-cycle-continues","text":"The gas from the nova is largely blasted off into space and the white dwarf cools back to its original temperature.

[!Caution] Be sure to read stellar structure before proceeding with this one The Proton-Proton Chain The proton-proton chain (or pp-chain ) is the main mechanism that converts hydrogen into helium-4 in the cores of low-mass stars. In doing so, energy is released which fuels the star. There are three branches of the pp-chain. However, they all start with the same two steps, the production of deuterium and helium-3 $$ \\begin{gather} ^1_1\\text{H} + ^1_1\\text{H}\\rightarrow\\ ^2_1\\text{H} + e^+ + \\nu_e\\ ^2_1\\text{H} + ^1_1\\text{H}\\rightarrow\\ ^3_2\\text{He} + \\gamma \\end{gather} $$ PP I branch This branch is the most typical branch that occurs for a pp-chain .

In the Sun We include the following nice diagram from Bradley's Introduction to Modern Astronomy which illustrates the branches along with their probability of occuring in the sun Temperature Requirement For a pp-chain to occur, the colliding nuclei must overcome the electrostatic repulsion between them to get into the regime of the strong nuclear force , whereby the nuclei fuses, we call this energy barrier the Coulomb barrier . Classically, we would expect only nuclei that possesses kinetic energy that surpasses that of the Coulomb barrier to react. In which case, considering the reduced mass \\(\\mu\\) of two colliding particles give $$ \\begin{gather} \\frac{1}{2}\\mu \\overline v_{rel}^2 = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\frac{q_1q_2}{r} \\Rightarrow \\frac{3}{2}kT = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\frac{q_1q_2}{r}\\ \\Rightarrow T = \\frac{1}{6\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\frac{q_1q_2}{rk}\\approx 10^{10}\\quad \\text{(for the sun)} \\end{gather} $$ However, from experimental observation, we find that pp-chain still happen in stars that operate at a temperatures much lower than this, for example our sun has a core temperature of \\(\\approx 1.57\\times10^{7} < 10^{10}\\) . This is because, in real life, quantum effects allows the nuclei to quantum tunnel through the Coulomb barrier, resulting in a much lower required temperature of $$ T = \\frac{q_1^2q_2^2\\mu}{12\\pi^2\\epsilon_0^2h^2k} $$ where - \\(\\mu\\) is the reduced mass - \\(\\epsilon_0\\) is vaccuum permittivity - \\(h\\) is the Planck constant - \\(k\\) is the Boltzmann constant For context, this temperature comes out to \\(\\approx 10^7\\) for the sun, which agrees with our observations. Main-Sequence Evolution As the pp-chain burns away hydrogen, the mean molecular weight of the core increases as we have substituted 4 lighter nucleus for 1 heavier nucleus. The mean molecular weight \\(\\mu\\) is defined as $$ \\mu = \\frac{\\overline m}{m_H} $$ where - \\(\\overline m\\) is the average nuclear mass in the star - \\(m_H\\) is the mass of a hydrogen atom. We know that the pressure at the core of the star is due to a combination of gas and radiation pressure, which is given by the hydrostatic pressure equation $$ \\begin{align } P &= \\frac{\\rho kT}{\\mu m_H} + \\frac{1}{3}aT^4 \\ &\\approx \\frac{\\rho kT}{\\mu m_H}\\quad \\text{(at low temperatures)} \\end{align } $$ where - \\(\\rho\\) is the density of the star - \\(k\\) is the Boltzmann constant - \\(T\\) is the temperature - \\(\\mu\\) is the mean molecular weight - \\(m_H\\) is the mass of a hydrogen atom We also know that a star exists in a state of hydrostatic equlibrium where the pressure inside the star fight against the gravitational collapse of the star. From the pressure equation , we see that as the mean molecular weight of the star increases the pressure will tend to decrease. As such, in order to maintain the pressure such that it can still support the weight of the star, either the density \\(\\rho\\) or the temperature \\(T\\) , or both must increase to compensate for the increase in \\(\\mu\\) . In this case both will increase in the following fashion. The decreased hydrostatic pressure becomes insufficient to fight against the gravitational collapse, thus the core compresses. As the core compresses the density \\(\\rho\\) is increased . Furthermore, this compression results in gravitational potential energy being released. By virial theorem , only half of the gravitational energy will be released in the form of radiation, with the other half being absorbed as heat which will increase the temperature \\(T\\) of the star. Now as the temperature is increased, there will be more parts of the star that reaches the [[#Temperature Requirement|temperature required]] to initiate hydrogen fusion, this causes there to be more pp-chain reaction . Furthermore, the rate at which the pp-chain occurs is also increased as $$ \\text{rate of pp reaction} \\propto \\rho\\mathcal X^2T^4 $$ where - \\(\\rho\\) is the density - \\(\\mathcal X\\) is the mole fraction of hydrogen - \\(T\\) is the temperature Hence, more energy is produced per unit time and the power delivery of the star increases, causing it to shine brighter . Leaving the Main-Sequence Eventually, the hydrogen at the core will be depleted , in which case the core will stop burning hydrogen and the core contracts due to gravitational collapse. This releases gravitational energy which heats up the outer envelope, which still contained hydrogen, causing hydrogen burning to resume. This continued hydrogen burning of the outer envelope causes the luminosity of the star to continue to rise . Furthermore, some of the energy generated by the envelope goes back into heating itself which causes it to further expand. The ash from the hydrogen burning in the envelope goes into increasing the mass of the helium core . Eventually the envelope of the star grows and cools sufficiently to become convective, in which case it has reached the Red Giant Phase Next: Red Giant The Sch\u00f6nberg\u2013Chandrasekhar Limit The Sch\u00f6nberg\u2013Chandrasekhar limit (SC limit) decribes the maximum ratio of core mass to star mass whereby the star is still able to support itself, it is given by $$ \\frac{M_{ic}}{M} = 0.37\\left(\\frac{\\mu_{env}}{\\mu_{ic}}\\right)^2 $$ where - \\(M_{ic}\\) is the mass of the core - \\(M\\) is the mass of the star - \\(\\mu_{env}\\) is the mean molecular weight of the envelope - \\(\\mu_{ic}\\) is the mean molecular weight of the core Exceeding the SC Limit Note, however, that the SC limit can be exceeded if there is another source of pressure supporting the weight of the star, aside from gas and radiation pressure. This can occur in the star if the electrons in the gas become degenerate , which happens when the gas density is so high that the electrons are forced to occupy the lowest possible energy state . However, due to Pauli's exclusion principle , which forbids electrons from occupying the same quantum state, the electrons will be stacked on progressively higher energy levels. This results in a sort of non-thermal electron degeneracy pressure which pushes against the gravitional collapse and allowing the star to exceed the Sch\u00f6nberg\u2013Chandrasekhar limit Questions! :) Question 1: Pressure Integral The pressure intergral computes the pressure distribution given some distribution function \\(n_pdp\\) $$ P = \\frac{1}{3}\\int_0^\\infty pvn_pdp $$ Calculate the expression for the radiation pressure of a star Add solutions here later Question 2: For an inverse square force, virial theorem states that $$ \\begin{gather} E = \\frac{1}{2} U\\ \\text{total mechanical energy} = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{potential energy} \\end{gather} $$ Furthermore, given that the gravitational potential energy of two particles is given by $$ U = -G\\frac{Mm}{r} $$ Find the total mechanical energy of a star given its mass \\(M\\) and radius \\(R\\) Add solution here later","title":"Low-Mass Stars"},{"location":"stellar/stars/low_mass_star/#low-mass-stars","text":"[!Definition] Stars that started out with mass in the range \\(0.3\\ M_\\odot\\) to \\(1.2\\ M_\\odot\\) The dominant mechanism that converts hydrogen into helium in low-mass stars is the pp-chain , which implies that the cores of low-mass stars are radiative . { align=center } A classic example of a low-mass star is our very own sun !
