A lot, a lot of gas. Description A molecular cloud is a cloud of light gas (mostly H \\(_2\\) ) and dust. These humongous clouds tend to take on twisted, long shapes, usually described as \" filamentary \". The temperature of these clouds can be as low as 10K, and span lightyears across in size. If the mass of a cloud exceeds the threshold where pressure can maintain equilibrium, gravitational collapse begins, and cloud fragments begin to implode until their cores are dense enough to be considered a protostar . Stability In many giant molecular clouds the density for a long-lived stable equlibrium to exist. In addition to gas pressure, magnetic forces also oppose the contraction of gas within the molecular cloud. Mostly, molecular clouds are too light, hot and magnetic for gravitational collapse to occur, so how does this happen? Usually cloud collapse is triggered by an event such as the collision of gas clouds or gravitational waves from supernovae. These events compress the gas on astronomical scales, kickstarting the star formation process. The gravitational forces of the dust gradually begins to overcome gas pressure, turbulence, rotation, and the magnetic field of the cloud, leading to cloud collapse at multiple points within the cloud. The waves and forces produced by these young stars pushes its surrounding gas together in a phenomenon known as starbursts where for a period the rate of star formation in a molecular cloud is greatly increased. Extra Extra Gravitational collapse In the 20th century, a scientist named James Jeans investigated this phenomenon of cloud collapse. Jeans found that fluctuations in size or mass larger than certain thresholds (now known as the Jeans Mass and Jeans Length) will cause instability in the molecular cloud and begin gravitational collapse. If the mass of a cloud exceeds the critical threshold (the Jeans Mass) where pressure can maintain equilibrium, gravitational collapse begins, kickstarting the formation of a star. Sometimes, an external event starts off this process. In triggered star formation , colliding clouds or gravitational waves compress gas on astronomical scales, accelerating the star formation process. This causes a phenomena called starbursts , where the number of stars formed within the molecular cloud is much higher than normal levels. The Jeans Mass (for a gas cloud of uniform density \\(\\rho_o\\) is defined based of the following equation: \\[ \\begin{align*} M_J &= \\sqrt{\\frac{(15k_\\text{B}T)^3 \\pi^5}{(128Gm)^3 \\rho_o}} \\\\ \\text{where: }& \\\\ k_\\text{B} &= 1.38065 \\times 10^{-23}\\text{ J K}^{-1} \\\\ G &= 6.674 \\times 10^{-11}\\text{ m}^3\\text{ kg}^{-1}\\text{ s}^{-2} \\\\ m &= 2m_p + 2m_e \\end{align*} \\] Derivation Okay, for the sake of argument, assume the molecular cloud is spherical and is startignt to gravitationally collapse.

In this state, it is not yet hot enough for hydrogen fusion to occur. Gravity pulls gas into a disk-like shape around the protostar, called a circumstellar disk . Accretion (Or collection) of dust from the circumstellar disk continues until the star is hot enough to reach a state of hydrostatic equilibrium. This accretion is the main source of energy for the star, as shock from matter smashing into the face of the star is turned into heat. At first, heat is lost rapidly to the void of space through radiation. However, as its mass increases, the protostar gradually becomes opaque to its own radiation. Heat can no longer escape and begins accumulating at the core of the nascent star. At a certain threshold, thermoneuclear reactions can occur, heating its outer shell and signalling the birth of a pre-main-sequence star. If its mass is between 2 and 10 solar masses, it turns into a Herbig Ae/Be star , and if its mass is less than 2 solar masses it turns into a T-tauri star NOTE: Some believe stars of mass lower than 0.5 solar mass never enter the T-tauri phase. However, there is also conflicting (but not conclusive) results suggesting the existence of a T-tauri phase in brown dwarfs. See [3]. Extra Extra: Protostar Structures Protoplanetary Disks Gas initially collapses towards the dense core of the protostar, but also begins to form a protoplanetary disk. The protoplanetary disk (Not to be confused with an accretion disk), as mentioned earlier, is where the protostar pulls in its mass from. As the protostar collapses under its own gravity, conservation of angular momentum causes the rotation of the star to speed up. Centripital accelleration from the rotation helps the external gas resist the radial pull of the star, while axially it continues to collapse, flattening the gas and particles into a disk Planet Formation From this relatively stable disk around the star, planets can form. It is widely believed that our solar system was birthed out of a system like this. Electrostatic and gravitational effects pull clumps of dust together against the push of stellar wind to create planetesimals. If the outward pushing solar wind and inward pulling gravity are stable for long enough, these planetesimals accrete into planets. Protostellar Jets Many depictions of protostars show jet-like shapes appearing to come axially out of the protostar. These mysterious structures are called protostellar jets, and though their origin is yet unknown, they play an important part in supporting the protostar. The most popular theory for their formation is that they are ejected from the protostellar disks by wide-angle winds, and are then collimated by the toroidal magentic fields.

If there are no big deviances of the composition of the star, the mass at which a star achieves hydrostatic equilibrium will have huge implications on the evolution of the star. If the mass is larger than 0.08 solar masses, then the energy is sufficient to cause the core of the star to become radiative. The heat causes the optical opacity of the star to drop, allowing energy to be radiated out quickly. As the star settles into its new equilibrium temperature, it turns into a Low Mass Star .

They are typically very cool (<600K) because of this, emitting wavelengths primarily in the infrared spectrum and relying on energy from gravitational collapse to supply heat. [3] Brown dwarves are very similar to large planets, but are typically distinguished from planets through one of two ways. The first is how the body is formed, with dwarves forming in gravitational collapse while planets forming through accretion of planetesimals. However, because of the difficulty in ascertaining the origin of observed objects astronomers often opt for a simpler criterion of the mass of the object. Brown dwarves are fuzzily defined as objects in the range between about 0.013 M\u2299 and 0.072 M\u2299[1, 6], but people argue about the precise thresholds often. Brown dwarves on the higher end of the mass spectrum (>60 M_j or ~0.0573M\u2299) are supported by electron degenracy pressure, while the less massive ones are held stable by Coulomb pressure. [4] Deuterium burning In brown dwarves, the self-gravity is insufficient for hydrogen burning to occur, but a process called deuterium burning can occur. \\[ ^2_1\\text{H} + ^1_1\\text{H}\\rightarrow\\ ^3_2\\text{He} + \\gamma \\] Deuterium fusion actually takes place in the hydrogen fusion process seen in main sequence stars. It is through deuterium burning and the gravitational collapse that brown dwarfs are still able to shine for about 10 million years after formation. Extra Extra History Brown dwarves were introduced as a way to compensate for the large number of observed objects with low temperatures (<1300K), and the first verified observation of a brown dwarf, Gliese 229B, was in 1995. [2] observations from 60-inch and 200-inch telescopes on Mount Palomar Gliese 229B, and many other brown dwarves since then, were discovered by surveying the area surrounding binary star systems. In the above image, Gliese 229B has a luminosity of only a few millionths that of the Sun. Because they are so small and dark, brown dwarves are very difficult to detect. Apart from this, infrared surveys and spectroscopic studies present additional ways to search for brown dwarves. Sub-brown dwarves The astute reader may have noted that protostars less than 0.08M\u2299 in mass turn into brown dwarves, but the definition of brown dwarves does not encompass that below 0.013M\u2299. What's going on there? Well, a brown dwarf is typically indicated by its ability to conduct deuterium fusion. Below the mass of 0.013M\u2299, the force of gravity is insufficient to support deuterium fusion. Typically low-mass objects like these are considered planets, but referring to them as planets in this case may lead to confusion, since they were formed in cloud collapse. In these cases, we call the object a sub-brown dwarf or planetary-mass brown dwarf. Classification Brown dwarves are typically classified broadly based on their spectral class. However, since the temperature of brown dwarves tends to fall lower than the lowest usual M classification, L T and Y classifications (which are almost exclusively used for brown dwarves) are employed. Class M brown dwarves are characteristically very close to red dwarves, as they encroach on the lowest corner of the main sequence. Most scientists consider a star of class M6.5 or lower to be a brown dwarf[7]. Class T and L dwarves dwell between 550 and 1,300 K and 1,300 to 2,000 K bands respectively. These small brown dwarves are often formed from a proplyd (protoplanetary disk) whose gas has been lost to nearby protostar. Class Y dwarves are very difficult to spot, as their temperature is that below 550K.

As it collapses, gravitational energy is released, heating up what is an already very hot core. Eventually, once the matter gets squeeze together close enough, electron degeneracy pressure kicks in, preventing further collapse of the core. The result of this is a very hot but relatively dim white dwarf . Electron Degeneracy Pressure Electron degeneracy pressure arises as a result of Pauli's Exclusion Principle which forbids two electrons (or more generally two fermions) from occupying the same quantum state at the same time. If two electrons are forced into these conditions, one would quickly dart away in order to not occupy the space of another. This movement of electrons creates a form of pressure that pushes against gravity, halting the star's gravitational collapse. This pressure is known as the electron degeneracy pressure . Furthermore, it has been shown that the speed at which these electrons dart away are in the relativistic regime. In which case, the electron degeneracy pressure can be calculated as $$ P_e \\approx \\left(\\frac{3}{8\\pi}\\right)^{1/3}\\frac{hc}{4m_p^{4/3}}\\left(\\frac{Z}{A}\\right)^{4/3}\\rho^{4/3} $$ Derivation of Electron Denegeneracy Pressure (Optional) We have the following pressure integral for calculating the pressure given a distribution. $$ P = \\frac{1}{3}\\int_0^{\\infty} pv_pn(p)dp $$ The Fermi-Diract distribution function for fermions is given by $$ n(p)dp = g_s\\frac{4\\pi p^2}{h^3}dp\\left[\\frac{1}{e^\\frac{(E - \\mu)}{kT} + 1}\\right] $$ As electrons have spin \\(s = 1/2\\) , we have \\(g_s = 2s + 1 = 2\\) The fraction \\(\\frac{1}{e^\\frac{(E - \\mu)}{kT} + 1}\\) is the occupation number, and for a degenerate gas it is 1.

All Good Things Must Come to an End. As there is no energy production happening in the white dwarf, its brightness if purely sustained by the left-over heat from its red giant phase and is gravitational collapse.

If two electrons are forced into these conditions, one would quickly dart away in order to not occupy the space of another. This movement of electrons creates a form of pressure that pushes against gravity, halting the star's gravitational collapse. This pressure is known as the electron degeneracy pressure . Furthermore, it has been shown that the speed at which these electrons dart away are in the relativistic regime. In which case, the electron degeneracy pressure can be calculated as $$ P_e \\approx \\left(\\frac{3}{8\\pi}\\right)^{1/3}\\frac{hc}{4m_p^{4/3}}\\left(\\frac{Z}{A}\\right)^{4/3}\\rho^{4/3} $$ Derivation of Electron Denegeneracy Pressure (Optional) We have the following pressure integral for calculating the pressure given a distribution. $$ P = \\frac{1}{3}\\int_0^{\\infty} pv_pn(p)dp $$ The Fermi-Diract distribution function for fermions is given by $$ n(p)dp = g_s\\frac{4\\pi p^2}{h^3}dp\\left[\\frac{1}{e^\\frac{(E - \\mu)}{kT} + 1}\\right] $$ As electrons have spin \\(s = 1/2\\) , we have \\(g_s = 2s + 1 = 2\\) The fraction \\(\\frac{1}{e^\\frac{(E - \\mu)}{kT} + 1}\\) is the occupation number, and for a degenerate gas it is 1.

Stargazers of ancient times believed that new stars were created, as the bursts of light seemed to appear from nowhere in the night sky -- hence their name nova , which means \"new\" in Latin. Astronomers today now know that novas are not, in fact, new stars, but rather white dwarves -- stars that have already reached the end of their main sequence and are now husks of mainly carbon and oxygen. Where does the light come from? White dwarves are stars that are \"dead\": nuclear fusion no longer occurs in them, and their faint white glow comes from the radiation they produce due to whatever temperature they have left -- not a likely source of a burst of light. In reality, novas cannot occur with any white dwarf, but rather only those that are in Binary White Dwarf Systems . In a binary white dwarf system, the white dwarf tends to attract gas from its partner to itself, which forms an accretion disk around the white dwarf. The gases in the accretion disk cannot keep on orbiting the white dwarf forever -- resistive forces caused by viscosity in the gas surrounding the white dwarf cause the gas to slow down and fall towards the white dwarf, eventually landing on its surface. As more gas builds up on the surface of the white dwarf, it gets hotter and denser. Eventually, the hydrogen gets hotter and hotter until reaching a critical point of about 20 million Kelvin, at which point the hydrogen ignites and begins to undergo nuclear fusion into helium. As a refresher, this nuclear reaction is exactly the same as the reaction that the cores of stars in their main sequence undergo to produce their energy. \\[ 4\\ce{^{1}_{1}H} + 2\\ce{^{0}_{-1}e} \\rightarrow \\ce{^{4}_{2}He} + 2\\nu \\] The fusion reaction releases a very large amount of energy, resulting in radiation in the visible range. The rapid heating causes the gas to expand rapidly, blowing most of it into space, where it then cools down. This is why novas flare up suddenly and then slowly fade back to their normal brightness. The still-bright gas from after a nova explosion The Cycle Continues The gas from the nova is largely blasted off into space and the white dwarf cools back to its original temperature. This marks a return to the original binary white dwarf system, where the white dwarf can go nova again, or even turn into a Type Ia Supernova for an even more spectacular burst of light.

In reality, novas cannot occur with any white dwarf, but rather only those that are in Binary White Dwarf Systems . In a binary white dwarf system, the white dwarf tends to attract gas from its partner to itself, which forms an accretion disk around the white dwarf. The gases in the accretion disk cannot keep on orbiting the white dwarf forever -- resistive forces caused by viscosity in the gas surrounding the white dwarf cause the gas to slow down and fall towards the white dwarf, eventually landing on its surface. As more gas builds up on the surface of the white dwarf, it gets hotter and denser. Eventually, the hydrogen gets hotter and hotter until reaching a critical point of about 20 million Kelvin, at which point the hydrogen ignites and begins to undergo nuclear fusion into helium. As a refresher, this nuclear reaction is exactly the same as the reaction that the cores of stars in their main sequence undergo to produce their energy. \\[ 4\\ce{^{1}_{1}H} + 2\\ce{^{0}_{-1}e} \\rightarrow \\ce{^{4}_{2}He} + 2\\nu \\] The fusion reaction releases a very large amount of energy, resulting in radiation in the visible range. The rapid heating causes the gas to expand rapidly, blowing most of it into space, where it then cools down. This is why novas flare up suddenly and then slowly fade back to their normal brightness.

These diffuse phenomena that we can still see from Earth are known as Supernova Remnants . One of the most well-known supernova remnants is the Crab Nebula , the remnant of a supernova that exploded close to nine centuries ago. Astronomers have recognised that the Crab Nebula must have resulted from an explosion due to how the gas cloud expands, creating a Doppler shift in the emission spectral lines that we can observe. An image of the Crab Nebula The formation of a Supernova Remnant The explosion of a supernova throws a huge mass of gas and stellar material away from the center, resulting in a large, expanding region of superheated material. This expanding gas cloud sweeps up the interstellar material, hence accumulating even more matter within the expanding remnant. The initial explosion of the supernova generates a shock wave that ripples outward from the star, passing through the stellar medium and into the interstellar space. Material that is hit by the shock wave is heated to very high temperatures reaching millions of Kelvin, and hence begin to emit X-rays. Recall that the peak radiation wavelength is given by Wien's displacement law, which states that \\[ \\lambda_{peak} T = b \\] In certain cases, the explosion of the supernova also forms a reverse shock wave that collapses back towards the center of the explosion. This usually occurs due to an expanding shell hitting another mass of gass, and the pressure buildup forcing the first shell to collapse back inwards. This effect has been observed in Cassiopeia A, one of the most prominent supernova remnants we have found. A diagram showing the two shock waves as a supernova explodes The phases of a Supernova Remnant The supernova remnant cannot keep expanding forever \u2014 as it sweeps up more and more interstellar material, it will lose energy to it and begin to slow down. The interstellar gas reaches densities too high for expansion to take freely. At this point, due to the rapid expansion of the shells, the matter ejected by the supernova and the swept-up material from the interstellar medium have not had the time to mix; however as the material slows down Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities begin to appear. A Rayleigh-Taylor instability simply describes how when two fluids of different densities mix, the more dense one will start penetrating the less dense one and the two will begin to mix. This is exactly what occurs in the slowed supernova remnant. As the remnant slows, it will also cool, radiating heat away from itself. Once the remnant cools to approximately 20 thousand Kelvin, the environment becomes stable enough for electrons to begin to recombine into heavier elements, which radiates even more energy. This is the final phase of the supernova remnant. The types of supernova remnant Supernova remnants are largely divided into 3 types based on their observable shapes. The first of these is known as the shell type , so named because the radiation originates largely from an outer shell of shocked material. When we see these remnants, they appear as a bright ring as we see the radiation from the outer ring. This phenomenon of having the outer portion more visible since there is more hot gas at the edges of our line of sight is known as limb brightening . A shell-type supernova remnant The second of these is known as the crab type , owing their appearance. As one might expect, the Crab Nebula shown earlier is indeed a crab-type supernova remnant. Unlike the shell-type remnants, which appear as a single bright ring with a hollow center, crab-type remnants have a pulsar at their center, which flings out electrons. The electrons moving at relativistic speeds interact with the magnetic field within the remnant created by the matter, emitting all forms of electromagnetic radiation in the form of synchrotron radiation . This causes the center of the remnant to appear bright as well. A crab-type supernova remnant The last type is simply known as the composite remnants, so named because they show properties of both the shell and crab types. There are two different ways this can occur: one of them is thermal composites , which radiate shell-like in radio waves and crab-like in X-rays, but another is plerionic composites, which appear crab-like but also manifest shell structures. A thermal composite supernova remnant. The red represents radio radiation, while the blue is x-rays. The end of the star? Supernova remnants remain as they are until they eventually radiate all their heat away. However, this process usually takes tens of thousands of years as the gases slowly cool, allowing them to remain visible for a very, very long time. Is the supernova truly the end of a star as all its mass is blown off into space? Not quite.

Supernovas obtain their name as they flare up suddenly like novas, but have even greater brightness than them as their name would suggest. Despite their similar names oweing to the similar phenomenon at the surface level, the mechanisms behind supernovas actually are quite distinct from that of novas. Supernovas vs Novas Unlike the recurring novas, supernovas explode only once. The reason for supernovas occuring only once is a direct result of the greater magnitude of their burst of brightness, since this greater energy release destroys the whole star. Types of Supernova Supernovas today are divided into two types, Type I and Type II, based on how much hydrogen they contain, deduced from the emission lines of their radiation. Type I supernovas are characterized by being hydrogen-poor, and have brightness curves more similar to those of novas. This article focuses specifically on Type Ia Supernovas: hydrogen-poor supernovas that arise from Binary White Dwarf Systems . Mass Accretion and Accumulation Recall that in a binary white dwarf system, the white dwarf can accrete mass from its partner. When too much gas accumulates and pressure increases, the gas will tend to ignite in the form of a nova ; however some gas still remains after the nova explosion. This remaining gas builds up over time, causing the mass of the white dwarf to increase. Balancing Pressures Opposing the gravity of the white dwarf trying to collapse in on itself is the electron degeneracy pressure . In simple terms, the electrons cannot be squeezed any closer, and exert an outward pressure to resist further collapse. However, once gravity gets too strong from too much mass, it can overcome this pressure. The mass at which this occurs is calculated to be about 1.4 solar masses, which is known as the Chandrasekhar mass or Chandrasekhar limit . The White Dwarf Collapses The collapsing white dwarf causes its core to be forced together again, increasing the core's density and hence the intensity of gravity. Pressures become high enough for the carbon core of the white dwarf to undergo carbon fusion , which is the same process of that in massive stars. Carbon fusion can yield multiple products, for example in the following: \\[ \\ce{^{12}_{6}C} + \\ce{^{12}_{6}C} \\rightarrow \\ce{^{20}_{10}Ne} + \\ce{^{4}_{2}He} \\ce{^{12}_{6}C} + \\ce{^{12}_{6}C} \\rightarrow \\ce{^{23}_{11}Na} + \\ce{^{1}_{1}H} \\ce{^{12}_{6}C} + \\ce{^{12}_{6}C} \\rightarrow \\ce{^{23}_{12}Mg} + \\ce{^{1}_{0}n} \\] This process generates a huge amount of energy as practically the whole star undergoes fusion at once. This burst of energy overcomes the gravitational pull of the white dwarf's matter, and the white dwarf explodes and releases a large amount of light, which we observe as a Type Ia Supernova . After the Explosion The white dwarf is obliterated in the supernova explosion, with its mass being thrown out into space by the force of the thermonuclear expansion and forming a supernova remnant.

This mass increases the gravity of the white dwarf until it overcomes the electron degeneracy and causes an imbalance in the pressures, leading to the collapse, and subsequent fusion of the carbon white dwarf. While the fusion does indeed occur partially due to the heating of the white dwarf as pressures increase, this is not related to the absorption of radiation from its partner, as the power gained from the process is extremely low. function markQ1(answer) { const wrong1 = document.getElementById(\"q1_1\") const wrong2 = document.getElementById(\"q1_3\") const right = document.getElementById(\"q1_2\") wrong1.classList.add(\"quizIncorrect\") wrong2.classList.add(\"quizIncorrect\") right.classList.add(\"quizCorrect\") } References: http://www.differencebetween.net/science/nature/differences-between-a-nova-and-a-supernova/ https://www.physics.rutgers.edu/analyze/wiki/Ia_supernovae.html (information and graph) https://www.schoolsobservatory.org/learn/astro/stars/cycle/ia_supernova","title":"Type Ia Supernova"},{"location":"stellar/nova/type_1a_supernova/#type-ia-supernova","text":"A visible supernova White dwarves in binary systems slowly accrete mass from their partners, and can eventually turn into novas or Type Ia Supernovas .

Core Implosion In a Type II Supernova, the core of the massive star runs out of hydrogen, causing gravity to pull it in and crush it. This results in the fusion of heavier elements, from hydrogen, to helium, all the way to iron, at which point fusion is no longer possible. Because of this, the energy from fusion no longer can balance the force of gravity, which crushes the iron core into an extremely small volume. The rest of the surrounding plasma, similarly pulled in by the gravity, hits the core and is pushed outwards in an explosion, giving rise to the Type II Supernova.

This induced electric field causes charged particles at the surface of the pulsar to be accelerated at high speeds, which then causes them to radiate.

Pulsars and Neutron Stars Pulsars are known to be spinning neutron stars, but they are not necessarily the only neutron stars that exist in the universe. Since the observation of a pulsar's pulses requires that the beams of electromagnetic radiation sweep across Earth, it is highly likely that for most neutron stars, Earth is not aligned with the beams to detect it, preventing us from seeing the characteristic pulses.

As the pulsar spins and radiates, it loses its own energy in the form of radiation. This causes the magnetic field strength and the angular velocity of the pulsar to steadily decrease, which causes its radiation to get weaker, until eventually its radiation is barely detectable at all. At this point, it no longer emits the pulses characteristic of a pulsar, and remains as a regular neutron star.

Let's start by exploring the history of this diagram. History The HR Diagram was the brainchild of its namesake, Danish astronomer Ejnar Hertzsprung (1873 - 1967) and American astronomer Henry Norris Russell (1877 - 1957). It was developed independently by both astronomers, in 1911 and 1914 respectively. The original HR Diagram was completely different from that pictured in Figure 1.3.1 . It looked a lot more like what is shown below: Figure 1.3.2: The Original HR Diagram (from Rochester Institute of Technology ) Notice that the y-axis is the Absolute Visual Magnitude, while the x-axis is populated by letters. These are Spectral Classes, which I've left as optional reading down below: More about Star Classification Star Classification Spectral Classes Spectral Classes are used to distinguish between different types of stars, based off color, temperature and other factors. The main factor is essentially the ionisatiom state of the star, although it can just be subtended to the surface temperature of the star. Specifically in the Morgan-Keenan Classification System of classification, which is the standard and was also used by both astronomers, we classify from O, B, A, F, G, K and M. As we go down the list, the temperature of the star decreases. Often, to abbreviate, we use the following pneumonics: \" O h, B e A F ine G irl, K iss M e\" \" O h B oy, A n F G rade K ills M e\" \" O bama B ought A F reaking G iant K illing M achine\" We often divide the spectral classes into 10 subdivisions, numerically from 0-9 . As this number decreases, the stars that occur become hotter. Thus, O0 is the hottest and M9 is the coldest. To summarise with examples, here's a helpful table! Class Color Surface Temperature (K) Example Actual Class O Blue \\(30,000 - 60,000\\) Mintaka Aa1 O9 B Blue-White \\(10,000 - 30,000\\) Rigel B8 A White \\(7500 - 10,000\\) Vega ( A0 ), Sirius ( A1 ) F Yellow-White \\(6000 - 7500\\) Canopus F0 G Yellow \\(5000 - 6000\\) Sun, Alpha Centauri G2 K Orange \\(3500 - 5000\\) Arcturus ( K2 ), Aldebaran ( K5 ) M Red \\(< 3500\\) Betelgeuse ( M2 ), Barnard's Star ( M5 ) If the star is even warmer than the \\(60,000\\text{ K}\\) , there is a special class known as the W class, which describes extremely hot and bluish stars known as Wolf-Rayet stars. On the other hand. Brown Dwarves are known to fall into a class lower than M. Luminosity Classes The Morgan-Keenan Classification System also accounts for stars of specific luminosities. Luminosity Class Star Type Example I Supergiants Betelgeuse (Red Supergiant) II Bright Giants III Giants IV Sub Giants V Main Sequence Stars Sun Main Sequence is the main class where most stars fall, such as our Sun. Stellar Spectra (Graphs) The following is a representation of the Stellar Spectra, broken down by the Spectral and Luminosity Classes as stated above.

These spectra are not displayed on a fixed intensity scale. The height of each spectrum is stretched to fill the display. To display a different spectrum, click a button on the left. By default, the spectrum of a G2V star like the Sun is shown. To measure the wavelength of a feature in the spectrum, click or click-and-drag. The wavelength is shown at the bottom of the display. For reference, visible light ranges from 400 to 700 nanometers. Ultraviolet is shorter in wavelength, infrared is longer. The Modern HR Diagram The diagram looks as such Figure 1.3.3: The Actual HR Diagram (From the ESA/HIPPARCOS Mission) Key Features The Key Features of the HR Diagram is as follows: Vertical Axis is some variant of the Luminosity, \\(L\\) or Absolute Visual Magnitude, \\(M\\) . (As we learnt in The Magnitude Scale , Absolute Visual Magnitude is a scaled form of \\(\\log L\\) .) Horizontal Axis is Temperature, but note , the axis is flipped. This means that as we go the right of the diagram, the temperature is in fact decreasing. The shape on the graph is largely predicated on what stars you identify, but most stars, as mentioned before, fall into the main sequence , the long line spanning the top left to bottom right of the graph. For the sake of this discussion, let's briefly go through each type of star. Main Sequence The behaviour of the main sequence stars is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law , \\(L = Ae\\sigma T^4\\) . To illustrate this relation, here is a diagram I've plotted: Figure 1.3.4: A plot of the possible pattern of main sequence stars.

Stars often spend billions and billions of years in this class, before it moves on to others. Pre-Main Sequence Pre-Main Sequence Stars tend to follow two different tracks to enter on their journey, the Henyey and Hayashi Tracks . To represent them as a diagram, here is a good depiction: Figure 1.3.5: Main Sequence stars often follow the above path in evolution. Source: Wikipedia The Hayashi Track Figure 1.3.6: A depiction of the Hayashi Track as taken by the T Tauri stars. The Hayashi Track is the almost vertical \"path\" that protostars (with masses less than \\(3 M_\\odot\\) ) take down the HR diagram, representing the gravitational collapse of T Tauri stars , wherein the collapsing star becomes less luminous due to a decreasing surface area. The Henyey Track The Henyey Track is a the nearly horizontal \"path\" to the main sequence that stars take after the Hayashi track, or right as they form if they have sufficient mass to kickstart hydrogen fusion in their cores (e.g. Herbig Ae/Be Stars ). This is when the nuclear fusion has just started and the star is slowly collapsing in order to reach hydrostatic equilibrium. Throughout this, the star becomes hotter, even whilst staying at a consistent luminosity. Giants and Supergiants Giants and Supergiants often tend to be red in color, which usually means their temperatures are very low. However, due to their relatively larger sizes and radii, they shine much, much brighter than even some blue main sequence stars. As we will later learn , giants are mostly formed long after a star enters main sequence, and are in fact vaguely visible via the naked eye, which means a large proportion of stars we see in the sky are in fact red giants. Dwarves Dwarves don't commonly occur, since the universe isn't old enough for such dwarves to have been formed in large majority. However, their characteristic abnormality is their lowly radiative luminosity given their high temperatures. We will read more about dwarves later . Optional Reading Key Variations of the Diagram Quick Note : This section is largely adapted based on work done by some of the team members for the Astrochallenge 2022 Data Analysis Question. Color Magnitude Diagrams Color Magnitude Diagrams are another way of approaching HR Diagrams. They are slightly varied, for instance using Magnitude instead of Luminosity, and \"Color\" instead of Temperature. Figure 1.3.5: A Color Magnitude Diagram based on the Data from the Gaia Early Data Release 3 (eDR3), specifically pertaining to the M67 Cluster as obtained via the HDBScan algorithm (Data Courtesy of the Gaia Early Data Release 3) As you can see, most of the features commonly associated with the HR Diagram, like the Supergiants and Dwarves and more, are missing, but why? This is mainly caused by the fact that M67 is a cluster that holds mostly stars that would have been created via the same molecular cloud. This means that their compositions and sizes are likely to be the same, other than perhaps some stars that have slowly edges towards giants, causing a slight movement. However, something that was strangely found was that if you actually obtained the entire Color Magnitude Diagram in the direction of M67, we would get a huge, HUGE patch underneath the main sequence line. Figure 1.3.6: The Actual Color Magnitude Diagram based on the Data from the Gaia Early Data Release 3 (eDR3), in the direction of the M67 Cluster. Highlighted in Blue is the M67 Color Magnitude Diagram as in Figure 1.3.5 (Data Courtesy of the Gaia Early Data Release 3) The reason for this is that not all of these are moving away at precisely the same speeds, whereas based on our current understanding of cosmology, the cluster itself moves slowly but roughly at the same speed away from us. This was in fact how we obtained the M67 cluster from the data, which is pretty cool. The XKCD Cut Randall Munroe from XKCD developed an amazing image illustrating an \"expanded\" version on the HR Diagram in Figure 1.3.1. See below: Figure 1.3.7: The \"Expanded\" Hertzprung Russell Diagram :smile: (Brought to you by XKCD ) A Final Quiz function markQ1(answer) { if(answer == 8) { document.getElementById(\"q1_9\").classList.add(\"quizCorrect\") let wrong = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] for(i of wrong) { document.getElementById(`q1_${i}`).classList.add(\"quizIncorrect\") } document.getElementById(\"q1_exp\").style.visibility = \"visible\"; } else { document.getElementById(`q1_${answer+1}`).classList.add(\"quizIncorrect\") } } function markQ2(answer) { if(answer == 1) { document.getElementById(\"q2_2\").classList.add(\"quizCorrect\") let wrong = [1, 3, 4] for(i of wrong) { document.getElementById(`q2_${i}`).classList.add(\"quizIncorrect\") } document.getElementById(\"q2_exp\").style.visibility = \"visible\"; } else { document.getElementById(`q2_${answer+1}`).classList.add(\"quizIncorrect\") } } If Betelgeuse were placed further away from Earth, what would happen to its position on the HR Diagram? North Northeast East Southeast South Southwest West Northwest No Change There is NO CHANGE , because the distance from earth does not make any difference on the Absolute Visual Magnitude as it isn't affected by distance at all. What are the stars that enter the Henyey Track pretty much immediately? T-Tauri Stars Herbig Ae/Be Stars Protostars Brown Dwarves The Herbig Ae/Be stars are the only stars with enough mass to kickstart hydrogen fusion in their cores.","title":"The Hertzprung-Russell Diagram"},{"location":"stellar/preliminaries/hr_diagram/#the-hertzsprungrussell-diagram","text":"","title":"The Hertzsprung\u2013Russell Diagram"},{"location":"stellar/preliminaries/hr_diagram/#overview","text":"Figure 1.3.1: The Combined, Labelled Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram (from European Space Astronomy ) The HR Diagram was developed years ago to represent the relationship between the Luminosity, \\(L\\) and the Surface Temperature, \\(T\\) .

This is mainly caused by the fact that M67 is a cluster that holds mostly stars that would have been created via the same molecular cloud. This means that their compositions and sizes are likely to be the same, other than perhaps some stars that have slowly edges towards giants, causing a slight movement. However, something that was strangely found was that if you actually obtained the entire Color Magnitude Diagram in the direction of M67, we would get a huge, HUGE patch underneath the main sequence line.

This is a brief overview of the Magnitude Scale system before we move on to the classification of stars. The understand the Magnitude System, we must first start by discussing the historical significance of the system. Hipparchus and the Greek Observation Hipparchus of Nicea (190 BC - 120 BC) was one of the many astronomers in the time of the Greeks, and influenced much of what we understand of astronomy today. What sets him apart is he is still considered, to this date, the greatest astronomical observer in history. His work on star catalogs, spherical trigonometry and more still astounds astronomers working today, but what we want to focus on today is his work on the Magnitude Scale. Prior to Hipparchus, most Greek astronomers believed that a star's brightness is only based on its size, which we now know is in fact false. There are many factors in play here, and we needed to spend more time analysing it. Then Hipparchus himself came to the scene. As perhaps the greatest anicient astronomer, he used his ingenuity to group stars up into specific classes based on their perceived brightness. He assigned discrete integer values to each star, such that the brightest stars would fall into the \"Stars of the First Magnitude\" and the barely visible stars were allocated to the \"Stars of the Sixth Magnitude\" . The problem with this system was unfortunately the fact that just plain observation is incredibly subjective, since stars often vary in brightness. However, this set the seedling for what was yet to come... Pogson's Law In 1856, an Astronomer working at Oxford University by the name of Norman Pogson came up with an efficient scale to work with the preset definitions from Hipparchus. He believed that our observation and hence tabulation of the magnitudes of different stars was influenced by a Logarithmic Scale. However, it wasn't purely based on a logarithmic scale in the conventional sense. Scaling and done to ensure that a simple step-down of 5 steps of magnitude would entail the star being about a hundred times brighter. To visualise, it would be something like this: \\[ \\frac{F}{F_\\text{ref}} = 100^{(m_\\text{ref} - m)/5} \\] or in other words: \\[ m = m_\\text{ref} + 2.5 \\log \\left(\\frac{F_\\text{ref}}{F}\\right) \\] Where we have that \\(F\\) and \\(m\\) are the flux (as intensity) and magnitude (as a decimal value). We have to base it off the referential object, reprsented by the \\(\\text{ref}\\) keyword. This is known as Pogson's Law , an incredibly important theorem in the field of stellar astronomy and observational astronomy. We can use this for comparisons between different variables or simply for identifying the magnitude/flux of the object to be observed. Ideally, if the value of \\(m\\) is larger than 6, we can just say that the object is invisible in the night sky via the use of the naked eye, although using traditional telescopes or even high-powered space-based observatories like the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), we can identify much, MUCH fainter stars, which is truly extraordinary. Noticeably, this result can be simplfied by essentially modifying to base of the exponent to be \\(100^{1/5} \\approx 2.512\\) instead of just \\(100\\) . Generally however, sticking to \\(100\\) is better for achieving a value closer to the actual value. However Reference Points For the most part, astronomers used to use Polaris (the North Star) as a reference, defining its magnitude as about \\(+2.0\\) . However, it was later found that Polaris was a variable star, which essentially means that its brightness would vary with time. We eventually moved to Vega, another star whose brightness was believed to be about \\(+0.0\\) (the actual value was in fact \\(+0.026\\) ). However, recent studies have shown that Vega is also variable, although we have not yet identified the next best reference point. However, for a better compilation, we can list the following samples: Reference Point Reference \\(m\\) Reference Point Reference \\(m\\) Sun -26.74 Full Moon -12.7 Venus -4.5 Jupiter -2.5 Saturn +0.7 Sirius -1.46 Canopus -0.72 Alpha Centauri -0.01 Arcturus -0.04 Vega +0.026 Capella +0.08 Rigel +0.18 Procyon +0.34 Achernar +0.50 Polaris +1.97 Looking through this expansive list, we are able to identify some key sources. We have the brightest planets in the night sky, namely Venus, Jupiter and Saturn. Sirius is the brightest star in the night sky, and Alpha Centauri is the closest star to our solar system beyond, of course, our Sun. The Fundamental Flaw with \\(m\\) As you've seen, we've used \\(m\\) here to represent the visual magnitude, but this is in fact the apparent visual magnitude. The readings in the above system only match up based on a specifc common origin, which in this case is the earth. However, at other points, this same visual perception would be vastly different. For a simple set-up, consider viewing the Sun from the Earth and Saturn, as shown in the diagram below. Figure 1.1.1: Comparison of Luminosities of the Sun from Earth and Saturn It is a noticeable difference, and it is also apparent in the values for \\(F\\) . Based on our understanding of flux intensity, we have the following: \\[ F = \\frac{P}{A} = \\frac{L}{4\\pi R^2} \\] This means that at further distances, the flux decreases. Hence the value for \\(m\\) at Saturn will NOT be \\(-26.74\\) . This poses an important issue in the face of astronomers, and they have come up with two different ways to fix this, namely the following: Scaling based on Distance Establishing a Universal Standard Let's cover both of them. Relating to Distance Considering the same flux equation above, we can easily extrapolate the following relation for the same star from varied distances: \\[ \\begin{align*} F_1 &= \\frac{L}{4\\pi R_1^2} \\\\ F_2 &= \\frac{L}{4\\pi R_2^2} \\\\ \\frac{F_1}{F_2} &= 100^{(m_2 - m_1)/5} \\\\ \\frac{\\frac{L}{4\\pi R_1^2}}{\\frac{L}{4\\pi R_2^2}} &= 100^{(m_2 - m_1)/5} \\\\ \\frac{R_2}{R_1} &= 10^{(m_2 - m_1)/5} \\\\ m_2 - m_1 &= 5 \\log \\left(\\frac{R_2}{R_1} \\right) \\end{align*} \\] This can be used easily to scale the magnitude. For instance, if the object is brought ten times closer, the new magnitude is 5 times larger. We also see that magnitude increases with increases distance, so for some arbitrary point. It follows the following graph: Figure 1.1.2: Plot of m as it varies with R (Reference Point is the Sun) Code Used to Create the Plot above # Plot of Magnitude as it varies with Distance import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from matplotlib.figure import Figure from matplotlib import image from matplotlib.offsetbox import OffsetImage , AnnotationBbox plt . rcParams [ 'axes.facecolor' ] = 'black' plt . rcParams [ 'savefig.facecolor' ] = 'black' msun = - 26.74 Rsun = 1.495978707e11 R = 10 ** np . linspace ( 0 , 12 , 100000 ) m = msun + 5 * ( np . log ( R / Rsun ) / np . log ( 10 )) xspecial = [ Rsun ] yspecial = [ msun ] # Initialize Subplots fig , ax = plt . subplots ( figsize = ( 10 , 10 ), facecolor = \"black\" ) # Special Earth Location im = image . imread ( \"earth.png\" ) ax . imshow ( im , aspect = 'auto' , extent = ( xspecial [ 0 ] - 1e10 , xspecial [ 0 ] + 1e10 , yspecial [ 0 ] - 1 , yspecial [ 0 ] + 1 )) ax . text ( xspecial [ 0 ], yspecial [ 0 ] + 2 , \"At Earth\" , color = 'white' ) # Plot Axes ax . plot ( R , m , c = \"white\" , alpha = 0.8 ) # Set bottom and left spines as x and y axes of coordinate system ax . spines [ 'bottom' ] . set_position ( 'zero' ) ax . spines [ 'left' ] . set_position ( 'zero' ) # Remove top and right spines ax . spines [ 'top' ] . set_visible ( False ) ax . spines [ 'right' ] . set_visible ( False ) # Set Everything as White ax . spines [ 'bottom' ] . set_color ( 'white' ) ax . spines [ 'left' ] . set_color ( 'white' ) ax . xaxis . label . set_color ( 'white' ) ax . yaxis . label . set_color ( 'white' ) ax . tick_params ( axis = 'x' , colors = 'white' ) ax . tick_params ( axis = 'y' , colors = 'white' ) # Create 'x' and 'y' labels ax . set_xlabel ( 'R' , size = 14 , x = 1.02 ) ax . set_ylabel ( 'm' , size = 14 , rotation = 0 , y = 1.02 , x = 0 ) # Draw arrows arrow_fmt = dict ( markersize = 4 , color = 'white' , clip_on = False ) ax . plot (( 1 ), ( 0 ), marker = '>' , transform = ax . get_yaxis_transform (), ** arrow_fmt ) ax . plot (( 0 ), ( 1 ), marker = '^' , transform = ax . get_xaxis_transform (), ** arrow_fmt ) plt . show () Establishing a Universal Standard: The Absolute Magnitude Another general solution was later established , which introduced a universal standard known as the Absolute Magnitude . This system was defined based on a referential distance, that is to say that the absolute magnitude, \\(M\\) would occur at that specific distance from any given object. This distance was 10 parsecs . For the sake of this context, let a parsec ( \\(\\text{pc}\\) ) be a given unit of measurement, similar to a lightyear or AU. By definition, \\(1\\text{ pc} = 3.086 \\times 10^{16}\\text{ m} = 3.262\\text{ ly}\\) . Hence we had the following equation: \\[m - M = 5 \\log \\left(\\frac{R}{10 \\text{ pc} } \\right)\\] Of course, if this wasn't enough, Astronmers have an interesting term for the Left-Hand Side of the above Equation, \\(\\mu = m - M\\) . This value is known as the distance modulus , since it is only really affected by the distance from the given object. We often use \\(M\\) instead so that we can get an accurate perception of a given star, and this comes in handy with stellar evolution. Notably, if we were to represent \\(R\\) in parsecs, we have the following: \\[M = m + 5 - 5\\log R\\] This is useful since the distance in parsecs is also known as the parallax of any given object, \\(\\pi\\) . Hence, \\[M = m + 5 - 5\\log \\pi\\] For instance, the absolute magnitude of the Sun is given by \\(+4.83\\) . Fun Questions A Triple Star System Question Solution (a) Solution (b) Solution (c) A Triple Star System is defined for where three stars move around another in a consistent eclipse. Most stable triple star systems involve a faraway star influencing an eclipsing binary star system. Let's assume, for the sake of this discussion, that this oscillating system is observed in the eclipsing pattern, that is to say that they move along a singular planar line with reference from the earth. Thus, while in reality, the situation is very much as shown in the below image: However, from Earth, the view would be more so as shown in the diagram below: Assuming that these are identical stars and hence emit identical luminosities, and assuming that the nearest point for the independent teritiary or the binary star system (which you can treat as a singular entity) is given by a distance variable \\(R\\) , and the radius of the circular orbit is of radius \\(\\frac{R}{2}\\) , derive the magnitudes of the Eclipsing Binary (EB) and Tertiary Candidate (TC) when: the tertiary candidate is furthest. the tertiary candidate is closest. the tertiary candidate and eclipsing binary are equidistant from the Earth Assume that for overlap, no light is blocked (unrealistic circumstance). Leave your answer in terms of the absolute magnitude of any one of the given stars, \\(M\\) , and \\(R\\) . For Part (a), let's visualise the solution as below: This is a pretty interesting solution. First, let's start by obtaining the visual magnitude of the tertiary candidate (TC) and the eclipsing binary (EB). \\[ \\begin{align*} m_\\text{TC} &= M_\\text{TC} + 5 \\log \\left(\\frac{2R}{10 \\text{ pc} } \\right) \\\\ m_\\text{EB} &= M_\\text{EB} + 5 \\log \\left(\\frac{R}{10 \\text{ pc} } \\right) \\end{align*} \\] We can arbitrate \\(M_\\text{TC}\\) to be \\(M\\) , the absolute magnitude of any of the given stars. As for \\(M_\\text{EB}\\) , we must use Flux to conclude what the value for this is. Since the two stars in the eclipsing binary are effectively identical, the flux from both stars can be represented as a variable \\(F\\) . Thus: \\[ \\begin{align*} M_\\text{EB} &= M + \\log \\left(\\frac{F}{F_\\text{EB} } \\right) \\\\ &= M - \\log 2 \\end{align*} \\] Thus, we have the following: \\[ \\begin{align*} m_\\text{TC} &= M + 5\\log 2 + 5 \\log \\left(\\frac{R}{10 \\text{ pc} } \\right) \\\\ m_\\text{EB} &= M - \\log 2 + 5 \\log \\left(\\frac{R}{10 \\text{ pc} } \\right) \\end{align*} \\] For Part (b), let's visualise the solution as below: This is a pretty interesting solution. First, let's start by obtaining the visual magnitude of the tertiary candidate (TC) and the eclipsing binary (EB). \\[ \\begin{align*} m_\\text{TC} &= M_\\text{TC} + 5 \\log \\left(\\frac{R}{10 \\text{ pc} } \\right) \\\\ m_\\text{EB} &= M_\\text{EB} + 5 \\log \\left(\\frac{2R}{10 \\text{ pc} } \\right) \\end{align*} \\] We can arbitrate \\(M_\\text{TC}\\) to be \\(M\\) , the absolute magnitude of any of the given stars. As for \\(M_\\text{EB}\\) , from Part (a), \\[M_\\text{EB} = M - \\log 2\\] Thus, we have the following: \\[ \\begin{align*} m_\\text{TC} &= M + 5 \\log \\left(\\frac{R}{10 \\text{ pc} } \\right) \\\\ m_\\text{EB} &= M - \\log 2 + 5\\log 2 + 5 \\log \\left(\\frac{R}{10 \\text{ pc} } \\right) \\\\ &= M + 4\\log 2 + 5 \\log \\left(\\frac{R}{10 \\text{ pc} } \\right) \\end{align*} \\] For Part (c), let's visualise the solution as below: This is a pretty interesting solution. First, let's start by obtaining the visual magnitude of the tertiary candidate (TC) and the eclipsing binary (EB). \\[ \\begin{align*} m_\\text{TC} &= M_\\text{TC} + 5 \\log \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{10} }{2}\\frac{R}{10 \\text{ pc} } \\right) \\\\ m_\\text{EB} &= M_\\text{EB} + 5 \\log \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{10} }{2}\\frac{R}{10 \\text{ pc} } \\right) \\end{align*} \\] We can arbitrate \\(M_\\text{TC}\\) to be \\(M\\) , the absolute magnitude of any of the given stars. As for \\(M_\\text{EB}\\) , from Part (a), \\[M_\\text{EB} = M - \\log 2\\] Thus, we have the following: \\[ \\begin{align*} m_\\text{TC} &= M + \\frac{5}{2} + 5 \\log \\left(\\frac{R}{20 \\text{ pc} } \\right) \\\\ m_\\text{EB} &= M - \\log 2 + \\frac{5}{2} + 5 \\log \\left(\\frac{R}{20 \\text{ pc} } \\right) \\end{align*} \\]","title":"Magnitude Scale"},{"location":"stellar/preliminaries/magnitude_scale/#magnitude-scale","text":"Please Note This is an optional reading, not to be graded.

Most stable triple star systems involve a faraway star influencing an eclipsing binary star system. Let's assume, for the sake of this discussion, that this oscillating system is observed in the eclipsing pattern, that is to say that they move along a singular planar line with reference from the earth. Thus, while in reality, the situation is very much as shown in the below image: However, from Earth, the view would be more so as shown in the diagram below: Assuming that these are identical stars and hence emit identical luminosities, and assuming that the nearest point for the independent teritiary or the binary star system (which you can treat as a singular entity) is given by a distance variable \\(R\\) , and the radius of the circular orbit is of radius \\(\\frac{R}{2}\\) , derive the magnitudes of the Eclipsing Binary (EB) and Tertiary Candidate (TC) when: the tertiary candidate is furthest. the tertiary candidate is closest. the tertiary candidate and eclipsing binary are equidistant from the Earth Assume that for overlap, no light is blocked (unrealistic circumstance). Leave your answer in terms of the absolute magnitude of any one of the given stars, \\(M\\) , and \\(R\\) . For Part (a), let's visualise the solution as below: This is a pretty interesting solution.

As for \\(M_\\text{EB}\\) , we must use Flux to conclude what the value for this is. Since the two stars in the eclipsing binary are effectively identical, the flux from both stars can be represented as a variable \\(F\\) . Thus: \\[ \\begin{align*} M_\\text{EB} &= M + \\log \\left(\\frac{F}{F_\\text{EB} } \\right) \\\\ &= M - \\log 2 \\end{align*} \\] Thus, we have the following: \\[ \\begin{align*} m_\\text{TC} &= M + 5\\log 2 + 5 \\log \\left(\\frac{R}{10 \\text{ pc} } \\right) \\\\ m_\\text{EB} &= M - \\log 2 + 5 \\log \\left(\\frac{R}{10 \\text{ pc} } \\right) \\end{align*} \\] For Part (b), let's visualise the solution as below: This is a pretty interesting solution.

While we may now have a much better understanding of stars, stars we've never been to or \"in\", for that matter, that wasn't the case even a century ago. In Einstein's time, the idea that the Sun was powered by a core where the very elements of Hydrogen came together in the proton-proton chain would be considered absurd, at best. Cecilia Payne was the true source behind our understanding of the stellar structure, an outspoken voice and truly extraordinary brain who, despite being bogged down by the then-sexist ideals of male supremacy, was able to not just make a crucial discovery, but also explain it in a way perhaps not done before. The Absorption Spectrum In Stellar Spectroscopy, we follow the concept of spectra , which are crucial in not just seeing the variation of light but also in identifying specific elements that the origin is made of.

We know that this structure does NOT hold, since anything which holds a certain amount of molecules, \\(n\\) , exerts an outward pressure, \\(P\\) . The intuition behind this is the consistent collisions of molecules against the walls of the container, exerting a large force per unit area which leads to an outward pressure. To counteract this pressure, we suggest that these molecules are in fact giant masses, owing to us currently exploring how a star might work. If these molecules are so big, we know that there is a net inward gravitational force which suggests that we can counteract the outward pressure with \"gravitational pressure\". This is known as hydrostatic equilibrium . A graphical representation of this can be seen below: Figure 1.2.1 - Forces acting on our idealised depiction of a Star. The Actual Structure of the Star \\(M < 0.5\\text{ }M_\\bigodot\\) \\(0.5\\text{ }M_\\bigodot < M < 1.5\\text{ }M_\\bigodot\\) \\(M > 1.5\\text{ }M_\\bigodot\\) Figure 1.2.2 - The Composition of a Star. The Core The core is the site of true nuclear fusion . This is where nuclear processes such as the proton-proton chain , CNO cycle and triple alpha process take place. Note For the sake of this article, we won't go in depth on the different reactions, as they will be brought up in later articles. Notably, since there is a consistent gravitational compression, the pressure at the center of the star is the highest, thus the core is much hotter (by Gay-Lussac's Law). Hence, the highest star temperature is at the core, which nuclear fusion uses as a furnace! The Convective Zone The Convective Zone occurs when the gravitational compression is not so high such that atoms are broken down in electrons and nuclei. Convection occurs here, as hot plasma from the core slowly rises, taking the place of the denser, cooler plasma that falls back into the core. This way, energy is transferred slowly in the form of an adiabatic cooling cycle. Notably, in different mass stars, this zone occurs at different locations, but no matter what, it always exists. Such cannot be said about the next: The Radiative Zone The Radiative Zone is where you'd largely see heat being transferred via radiative transfer, in addition to thermal conduction. Notably, due to the immensely dense nature of the radiative zone, especially for main sequence stars, photons being transferred keep colliding with electrons which causes immense amounts of scatterings and this generally leads to most of the photons taking forever to get our of the zone. In addition, when they collide wit the nuclei, the nuclei absorb most of the light, leaving only some to be emitted: the emission spectra . Optional Readings The Key Equations There are four key differential equations that dictate the star's evolution history. The Equation of Mass Continuity Given a mass \\(M(r)\\) is contained within a radius \\(r\\) , with density \\(\\rho(r)\\) , we have: $$ \\frac{d}{dr} M(r) = 4\\pi r^2 \\rho(r) $$ Nothing much is to be said here, except this result is very useful for the other 3 equations. The Equation of Hydrostatic Equilibrium For the above situation, it must be balanced by an outward gas pressure \\(P(r)\\) such that: \\[ \\begin{align*} \\frac{d}{dr} P(r) &= - \\rho(r) \\frac{GM(r)}{r^2} \\\\ \\text{or otherwise, }\\frac{dP}{dM} &= - \\frac{GM(r)}{4\\pi r^4} \\\\ \\text{We can hence solve this via:} \\\\ 4\\pi \\int_0^r r^4 \\frac{dP}{dr} dr &= G \\int_0^M M(r) dM \\\\ 4\\pi (r^4 P(r) - 4\\int_0^r r^3 P dr) &= G\\frac{(M(r))^2}{2} \\\\ \\end{align*} \\] The Equation of Energy Conservation Given a star has some outward luminosity, \\(L\\) for a given mass \\(M(r)\\) of density \\(\\rho(r)\\) and energy per unit mass per unit time \\(\\varepsilon(r)\\) (which is defined based on the chemical composition and mass, density and temperature), it holds that: \\[ \\begin{align*} \\frac{dL}{dr} &= 4\\pi r^2 \\rho(r) \\varepsilon(r) \\\\ \\text{or by Eqn 1, }\\frac{dL}{dM} &= \\varepsilon(r) \\end{align*} \\] The Equation for Radiative Energy Transfer To represent the Temperature, \\(T(r)\\) of this given star, based on the radiative energy transferred to that distance, in addition some radiative resistance \\(\\kappa(r)\\) , \\[ \\begin{align*} \\frac{d}{dr} T(r) &= - \\frac{3\\kappa(r)\\rho(r)L(r)}{16\\pi r^2 ac (T(r))^3} \\\\ \\text{or by Eqn 1, }\\frac{dT}{dM} &= -\\frac{3\\kappa(r)L(r)}{64\\pi^2 acr^4 (T(r))^3} \\end{align*} \\] A Final Quiz function markQ1(answer) { if(answer == 3) { document.getElementById(\"q1_4\").classList.add(\"quizCorrect\") let wrong = [1, 2, 3] for(i of wrong) { document.getElementById(`q1_${i}`).classList.add(\"quizIncorrect\") } document.getElementById(\"q1_exp\").style.visibility = \"visible\"; } else { document.getElementById(`q1_${answer+1}`).classList.add(\"quizIncorrect\") } } function markQ2(answer) { if(answer == 1) { document.getElementById(\"q2_2\").classList.add(\"quizCorrect\") let wrong = [1, 3, 4] for(i of wrong) { document.getElementById(`q2_${i}`).classList.add(\"quizIncorrect\") } document.getElementById(\"q2_exp\").style.visibility = \"visible\"; } else { document.getElementById(`q2_${answer+1}`).classList.add(\"quizIncorrect\") } } What counteracts the outward pressure of molecules in hydrostatic equilibrium?

We know that this structure does NOT hold, since anything which holds a certain amount of molecules, \\(n\\) , exerts an outward pressure, \\(P\\) . The intuition behind this is the consistent collisions of molecules against the walls of the container, exerting a large force per unit area which leads to an outward pressure. To counteract this pressure, we suggest that these molecules are in fact giant masses, owing to us currently exploring how a star might work. If these molecules are so big, we know that there is a net inward gravitational force which suggests that we can counteract the outward pressure with \"gravitational pressure\".

A classic example of a low-mass star is our very own sun ! Caution Be sure to read stellar structure before proceeding with this one The Proton-Proton Chain The proton-proton chain (or pp-chain ) is the main mechanism that converts hydrogen into helium-4 in the cores of low-mass stars. In doing so, energy is released which fuels the star. There are three branches of the pp-chain. However, they all start with the same two steps, the production of deuterium and helium-3 $$ ^1_1\\text{H} + ^1_1\\text{H}\\rightarrow\\ ^2_1\\text{H} + e^+ + \\nu_e $$ $$ ^2_1\\text{H} + ^1_1\\text{H}\\rightarrow\\ ^3_2\\text{He} + \\gamma $$ PP I branch This branch is the most typical branch that occurs for a pp-chain .

In the Sun We include the following nice diagram from Bradley's Introduction to Modern Astronomy which illustrates the branches along with their probability of occuring in the sun : Main-Sequence Evolution As the pp-chain burns away hydrogen, the mean molecular weight of the core increases as we have substituted 4 lighter nucleus for 1 heavier nucleus. The mean molecular weight \\(\\mu\\) is defined as $$ \\mu = \\frac{\\overline m}{m_H} $$ where: \\(\\overline m\\) is the average nuclear mass in the star \\(m_H\\) is the mass of a hydrogen atom. We know that the pressure at the core of the star is due to a combination of gas and radiation pressure, which is given by the hydrostatic pressure equation \\[ P = \\frac{\\rho kT}{\\mu m_H} + \\frac{1}{3}aT^4 \\] \\[ \\Rightarrow P \\approx \\frac{\\rho kT}{\\mu m_H}\\quad \\text{(at low temperatures)} \\] where: \\(\\rho\\) is the density of the star \\(k\\) is the Boltzmann constant \\(T\\) is the temperature \\(\\mu\\) is the mean molecular weight \\(m_H\\) is the mass of a hydrogen atom We also know that a star exists in a state of hydrostatic equlibrium where the pressure inside the star fight against the gravitational collapse of the star. From the pressure equation , we see that as the mean molecular weight of the star increases the pressure will tend to decrease. As such, in order to maintain the pressure such that it can still support the weight of the star, either the density \\(\\rho\\) or the temperature \\(T\\) , or both must increase to compensate for the increase in \\(\\mu\\) . In this case both will increase in the following fashion. The decreased hydrostatic pressure becomes insufficient to fight against the gravitational collapse, thus the core compresses. As the core compresses the density \\(\\rho\\) is increased . Furthermore, this compression results in gravitational potential energy being released. By virial theorem , only half of the gravitational energy will be released in the form of radiation, with the other half being absorbed as heat which will increase the temperature \\(T\\) of the star. Now as the temperature is increased, there will be more parts of the star that reaches the temperature required to initiate hydrogen fusion, this causes there to be more pp-chain reaction . Furthermore, the rate at which the pp-chain occurs is also increased as \\[ \\text{rate of pp reaction} \\propto \\rho\\mathcal X^2T^4 \\] where \\(\\rho\\) is the density \\(\\mathcal X\\) is the mole fraction of hydrogen \\(T\\) is the temperature Hence, more energy is produced per unit time and the power delivery of the star increases, causing it to shine brighter . Temperature requirement (Optional) For a pp-chain to occur, the colliding nuclei must overcome the electrostatic repulsion between them to get into the regime of the strong nuclear force , whereby the nuclei fuses, we call this energy barrier the Coulomb barrier . Classically, we would expect only nuclei that possesses kinetic energy that surpasses that of the Coulomb barrier to react. In which case, considering the reduced mass \\(\\mu\\) of two colliding particles give $$ \\frac{1}{2}\\mu \\overline v_{rel}^2 = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\frac{q_1q_2}{r} \\Rightarrow \\frac{3}{2}kT = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\frac{q_1q_2}{r} $$ $$ \\Rightarrow T = \\frac{1}{6\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\frac{q_1q_2}{rk}\\approx 10^{10}\\quad \\text{(for the sun)} $$ However, from experimental observation, we find that pp-chain still happen in stars that operate at a temperatures much lower than this, for example our sun has a core temperature of \\(\\approx 1.57\\times10^{7} < 10^{10}\\) . This is because, in real life, quantum effects allows the nuclei to quantum tunnel through the Coulomb barrier, resulting in a much lower required temperature of $$ T = \\frac{q_1^2q_2^2\\mu}{12\\pi^2\\epsilon_0^2h^2k} $$ where - \\(\\mu\\) is the reduced mass - \\(\\epsilon_0\\) is vaccuum permittivity - \\(h\\) is the Planck constant - \\(k\\) is the Boltzmann constant For context, this temperature comes out to \\(\\approx 10^7\\) for the sun, which agrees with our observations. Leaving the Main-Sequence Eventually, the hydrogen at the core will be depleted , in which case the core will stop burning hydrogen and the core contracts due to gravitational collapse. This releases gravitational energy which heats up the outer envelope, which still contained hydrogen, causing hydrogen burning to resume. This continued hydrogen burning of the outer envelope causes the luminosity of the star to continue to rise . Furthermore, some of the energy generated by the envelope goes back into heating itself which causes it to further expand. The ash from the hydrogen burning in the envelope goes into increasing the mass of the helium core . Eventually the envelope of the star grows and cools sufficiently to become convective, in which case it has reached the Red Giant Phase Next: Red Giant The limit of the core mass (Optional) The Sch\u00f6nberg\u2013Chandrasekhar limit (SC limit) decribes the maximum ratio of core mass to star mass whereby the star is still able to support itself, it is given by $$ \\frac{M_{ic}}{M} = 0.37\\left(\\frac{\\mu_{env}}{\\mu_{ic}}\\right)^2 $$ where - \\(M_{ic}\\) is the mass of the core - \\(M\\) is the mass of the star - \\(\\mu_{env}\\) is the mean molecular weight of the envelope - \\(\\mu_{ic}\\) is the mean molecular weight of the core Exceeding the core mass limit (Optional) Note, however, that the SC limit can be exceeded if there is another source of pressure supporting the weight of the star, aside from gas and radiation pressure. This can occur in the star if the electrons in the gas become degenerate , which happens when the gas density is so high that the electrons are forced to occupy the lowest possible energy state . However, due to Pauli's exclusion principle , which forbids electrons from occupying the same quantum state, the electrons will be stacked on progressively higher energy levels. This results in a sort of non-thermal electron degeneracy pressure which pushes against the gravitional collapse and allowing the star to exceed the Sch\u00f6nberg\u2013Chandrasekhar limit For more details, visit the article on white dwarves .
